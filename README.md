This repo is deployed on GitHub Pages and holds assets for curriculum exercises.

It is particulary useful for exercises with multiple phases, each with its own set of instructions.

## Usage

1. Create a folder with the name of the exercise.
1. Within the folder, add additional assets. E.g.,
   - `index.md`, a markdown file with additional instructions
   - image files
   - a folder with additional assets
1. Links to assets in this site will be at https://learning-fuze.github.io/exercise-assets/[exercise-name]/[asset]
   - Note: For markdown files, the asset should be referenced as `filename/`. For example, the markdown file `react-design/phase1.md` would be linked as `https://learning-fuze.github.io/exercise-assets/react-design/phase1/`
