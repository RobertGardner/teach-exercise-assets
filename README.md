This repo is deployed on GitHub Pages and holds assets for curriculum exercises.

It is particulary useful for exercises with multiple phases, each with its own set of instructions.

## Usage

1. Create a folder with the name of the exercise.
1. Within the folder, add additional assets. E.g.,
   - `index.md`, a markdown file with additional instructions
   - image files
   - a folder with additional assets
1. Links to assets in this site will be at `https://learning-fuze.github.io/exercise-assets/[exercise-name]/[asset]`
   - Note: To render markdown, it appears you have to name it `index.md` and reference it as `/exercise-assets/[exercise-name]/`. So if multiple markdown files are needed, they must be in separate folders, named `index.md` and referenced as `/exercise-assets/[exercise-name]/[folder-name]/`
