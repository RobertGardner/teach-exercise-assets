                 <h1 id="graph">Graph</h1>
<p>A <code>graph</code> is a versatile data structure that is similar to a tree. It consists of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (also called links). Each node represents an entity, and each edge represents a connection or relationship between two nodes. Graphs are used to represent many real-world applications: social networks, maps, routing algorithms, and more.</p>
<p>You may hear the phrase "graph theory" in computer science. Graph theory is the study of graphs and their properties. It's a vast field of study with many applications in computer science and other fields.</p>
<h2 id="visual-representation-of-a-graph">Visual Representation of a Graph</h2>
<p>Here is a visual representation of a few graphs:</p>
<p><img src="../images/graph.png"  alt="" /></p>
<p>The circles represent <code>nodes</code>, also called <code>vertex</code> or <code>vertices</code> (plural) and the lines connecting the nodes represent <code>edges</code>. If you think of a social network, you can think of the users as nodes and the connections or friendships between users as edges.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-graphs">Types of Graphs</h2>
<p>Graphs can be categorized into several types based on their properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Undirected Graph</strong>: In an undirected graph, the edges have no direction. If there is an edge between node A and node B, it implies a connection between both nodes in both directions. The top one is an undirected graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Directed Graph (Digraph)</strong>: In a directed graph, each edge has a specific direction. An edge from node A to node B indicates a one-way connection from A to B. The bottom one is a directed graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weighted Graph</strong>: In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. These weights represent the strength of the relationship or the distance between nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyclic Graph</strong>: A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle, which means there is a closed path in the graph. (See below for an example.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acyclic Graph</strong>: An acyclic graph is a graph that does not contain any cycles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connected Graph</strong>: A connected graph is one where there is a path between any two nodes. In other words, every node in the graph can be reached from any other node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disconnected Graph</strong>: A disconnected graph is one that consists of two or more separate subgraphs, and there is no path between nodes in different subgraphs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="graph-cycles">Graph cycles</h2>
<p>A cycle is a closed path in a graph. In other words, a cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node. Here is an example of a cycle in a graph:</p>
<p><img src="../images/graph-cycle.png"  alt="" /></p>
<p>A cycle starts and ends at the same node. In this example, the cycle is <code>b -&gt; c -&gt; e -&gt; d -&gt; b</code>. The cycle can be of any length, and it can contain any number of nodes.</p>
<p>So that is the gist of a graph. In the next lesson, we will learn about 2 ways to represent a graph and those are an adjacency matrix and adjacency list.</p>
