<p>A <code>linked list</code> is a linear data structure that is made up of a series of nodes. Each node contains a <code>value</code> and a <code>pointer</code>. A pointer can mean a lot of different things in programming, in the case of a linked list, it is a reference to another node in the list.</p>
<p>The first node in the list is called the <code>head</code>. The last node in the list is called the <code>tail</code>. The tail's pointer will be <code>undefined</code> to indicate that it is the last node in the list. We looked at a queue, which also has a head and a tail, but they serve different purposes. In a queue, the head refers to the front of the queue, where elements are <code>dequeued</code> (removed) from and the tail is where elements are <code>enqueued</code> (added). In a linked list, the head refers to the first node in the list and the tail refers to the last node and its pointer is always <code>undefined</code>. Elements can be added or removed from both the head and the tail.</p>
<p><img src="../images/linked-list1.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>As you can see in this image, we have a linked list with 4 nodes. Each node has a number as the value and a pointer that points to the next node. The last node or the <code>tail</code> has a pointer that is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node in a linked list contains a pointer to the next node. This can be very efficient in certain ways, such as inserting and deleting data. It just involves changing a few pointers and can have an O(1) time complexity. However, there are also use cases where they're not very efficient.</p>
<p>Just know that the basic building block of a linked list is the node, which typically contains two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data</strong>: It holds the value or payload that represents the information being stored in the linked list.</li>
<li><strong>Next</strong>: It is a reference to the next node in the sequence. This reference connects one node to the next, forming the link between nodes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="advantages-of-linked-lists">Advantages of Linked Lists</h2>
<p>Linked lists offer several advantages and use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic Size</strong>: Linked lists can easily grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed, as they do not require contiguous memory allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Insertion and Deletion</strong>: Inserting or deleting elements at the beginning or end of a linked list is efficient, as it involves updating the references in the affected nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Memory Allocation</strong>: Linked lists can be used when the memory allocation is not known in advance or needs to be managed dynamically.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation of Other Data Structures</strong>: Linked lists serve as a foundation for implementing other complex data structures, such as stacks, queues, and graphs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="drawbacks-of-linked-lists">Drawbacks of Linked Lists</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sequential Access</strong>: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not offer direct random access to elements. Accessing a specific element requires traversing the list from the beginning until the desired node is reached.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Memory Overhead</strong>: Linked lists require additional memory to store the references between nodes, which can result in higher memory usage compared to arrays for the same number of elements.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Traversal</strong>: While singly linked lists (with references to the next node only) can be traversed in one direction, reverse traversal or accessing the previous node requires a doubly linked list (with references to both the next and previous nodes).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next lesson, we will implement a linked list in TypeScript.</p>
