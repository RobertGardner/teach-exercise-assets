<p>Now we are going to get into some algorithms that involve binary trees. This one is called <code>Depth First Traversal</code>. This is a traversal algorithm where the algorithm starts at a <code>root</code> node, which we know is the one at the top of the tree with no parent, and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.</p>
<p>So if we look at the following tree:</p>
<p><img src="../images/depth-first.png" width="500" alt="" /></p>
<p>We would start at <code>a</code> and then go to <code>b</code>. From here, we would go to <code>d</code> because we are going as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. <code>d</code> is as far as we can go on this path because it is a <code>leaf node</code>, which means it has no children. So now we can move over to <code>e</code>. If <code>e</code> had a child, we would move down, but since it doesn't, we're going to move over to <code>c</code>. From <code>c</code>, we can move down in depth to <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>So this pattern would be <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>d</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>Now we want to implement this algorithm. We are going to use a <code>stack</code> to implement this algorithm because we want to keep track of the nodes we have visited. Remember a stack is a <code>LIFO</code> data structure, which means <code>Last In First Out</code>. So the last node we visit will be the first node we pop off the stack. When a node is popped off or removed from the stack, we can say that node has been <code>visited</code>. When a node is popped off the stack, it will be put in a variable called <code>current</code>. We will then check if <code>current</code> has a right child. If it does, we will add it to the stack. If it doesn't, we will check if it has a left child. If it does, we will add it to the stack. If it doesn't, we will pop the next node off the stack and repeat the process.</p>
<p>Let's implement this in TypeScript. We will use the same <code>Node</code> class we used in the previous lesson. We will first use a standard array as our stack, but then use the <code>Stack</code> class that we created a few lessons ago.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class Node&lt;T&gt; {
  data: T;
  left: Node&lt;T&gt; | undefined = undefined;
  right: Node&lt;T&gt; | undefined = undefined;

  constructor(data: T) {
    this.data = data;
  }
}

export function depthFirstTraversal(
  root: Node&lt;unknown&gt; | undefined
): unknown[] {
  if (!root) {
    return [];
  }

  const result: unknown[] = [];
  const stack: Node&lt;unknown&gt;[] = [];

  stack.push(root);

  while (stack.length &gt; 0) {
    const current = stack.pop();
    current &amp;&amp; result.push(current.data);

    if (current?.right) {
      stack.push(current.right);
    }

    if (current?.left) {
      stack.push(current.left);
    }
  }

  return result;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We did exactly what I described above. We first check if the <code>root</code> node exists. If it doesn't, we return an empty array.</p>
<p>We then create a <code>result</code> array and a <code>stack</code> array. We then push the <code>root</code> node onto the stack.</p>
<p>We then start a <code>while</code> loop that will run as long as the <code>stack</code> array has a length greater than <code>0</code>. Inside the <code>while</code> loop, we pop the last node off the stack and add it to the <code>result</code> array.</p>
<p>We then check if the <code>current</code> node has a right child. If it does, we add it to the stack. We then check if the <code>current</code> node has a left child. If it does, we add it to the stack.</p>
<p>We then repeat the process until the <code>stack</code> array has a length of <code>0</code>. We then return the <code>result</code> array.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-stack-class">Using the Stack Class</h2>
<p>Now, let's refactor this code to use the <code>Stack</code> class we created a few lessons ago. You can do this as an exercise, or you can look at the code below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class Node&lt;T&gt; {
  data: T;
  left: Node&lt;T&gt; | undefined = undefined;
  right: Node&lt;T&gt; | undefined = undefined;

  constructor(data: T) {
    this.data = data;
  }
}

export function depthFirstTraversal(
  root: Node&lt;unknown&gt; | undefined
): unknown[] {
  if (!root) {
    return [];
  }

  const result: unknown[] = [];
  const stack = new Stack();

  stack.push(root);

  while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
    const current = stack.pop();
    result.push(current.data);

    if (current.right) {
      stack.push(current.right);
    }

    if (current.left) {
      stack.push(current.left);
    }
  }

  return result;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code is very similar, except we used a pre-defined <code>Stack</code> class instead of a standard array. We also used the <code>isEmpty()</code> method instead of checking the length of the array.</p>
