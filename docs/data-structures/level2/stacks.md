# Level 2 - Stacks - Additional Practice

<progress value="4" max="9"></progress>

## Exercise

For this exercise you will be defining several functions that manipulate a stack. You are given a description of each function, a suite of unit tests for each function, and a JavaScript file in which to complete each function definition.

### Getting Started

The `Stack` class is defined in `lib/stack.js`.

The functions you will be implementing are declared in `stacks-2.js` and their tests are in `stacks-2.test.js`.

Remember to examine the code for the `Stack` class and to read all the tests for a function before you implement it.

### Additional Practice Problems

1. #### `countValues(stack)`

   ##### Parameters

   - `stack` - a `Stack` object containing zero or more values.

   ##### Return Value

   This function should return the number of values in the provided `stack`.

1. #### `maxValue(stack)`

   ##### Parameters

   - `stack` - a `Stack` object containing zero or more **numbers**.

   ##### Return Value

   This function should return `-Infinity` if the provided `stack` is empty.

   If the `stack` is not empty, the largest number in the `stack` should be returned.
