If you want, you can make the function case insensitive (and add a test to check it). Hints You can loop through a string just like you can loop through an array. You can use the ++ operator to increment a variable. You could take another approach and use the split() method to split the string into an array of substrings based on the given character. Solutions Click For Solution 1 export function countOccurrences(str: string, char: string): number { let count = 0; for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) { if (str[i] === char) { count++; } } return count; } // Case insensitive version // function countOccurrences(str: string, char: string): number { // const lowerStr = str.toLocaleLowerCase(); // const lowerChar = char.toLocaleLowerCase(); // let count = 0; // for (let i = 0; i < lowerStr.length; i++) { // if (lowerStr[i] === lowerChar) { // count++; // } // } // return count; // } Explanation Initialize a count variable to 0. Iterate through the string and check if the current character is equal to the character we're looking for. If it is, we increment the count variable. After the loop, we return the count variable. To make the function case insensitive, we can convert the string and character to lowercase before looping through the string. Click For Solution 2 export function countOccurrences(str: string, char: string): number { return str.split(char).length - 1; } Explanation Utilize the split method of the string to split it into an array of substrings based on the given character. Since splitting the string removes the character, the resulting array will have one less element than the number of occurrences of the character. Therefore, we can simply subtract 1 from the length of the array to get the count of occurrences. This solution may be prettier, but it actually is not as efficient as the loop. The for-loop solution directly counts the occurrences while iterating through the string, whereas the split solution involves splitting the string into an array and performing additional operations.

Remember, you want to remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the string before comparing it to the reversed string. There are multiple ways to do this, but one way is to use the replace method with a regular expression of /[^a-z0-9]/g . Solutions Click For Solution 1 This solution does not use a regular express to strip out non-alphanumeric characters. There are a few ways to do this. We are going to create some helper functions to make it easier. export function isPalindrome(str: string): boolean { const formattedStr = removeNonAlphanumeric(str.toLocaleLowerCase()); const reversedStr = reverseString(formattedStr); return formattedStr === reversedStr; } function removeNonAlphanumeric(str: string): string { let formattedStr = ''; for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) { const char = str[i]; if (isAlphaNumeric(char)) { formattedStr += char; } } return formattedStr; } function isAlphaNumeric(char: string): boolean { const code = char.charCodeAt(0); return ( (code >= '0'.charCodeAt(0) && code <= '9'.charCodeAt(0)) || // Numbers 0-9 (code >= 'a'.charCodeAt(0) && code <= 'z'.charCodeAt(0)) // Lowercase letters a-z ); } function reverseString(str: string): string { let reversed = ''; for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { reversed += str[i]; } return reversed; } Explanation Create a helper function called removeNonAlphanumeric that takes in a string and returns a new string with all non-alphanumeric characters removed. We do this by looping through the string and checking if each character is alphanumeric with another helper function called isAlphaNumeric . In the isAlphaNumeric function, we use the charCodeAt method to get the character code of the character. We then check if the character code is between the character codes for 0-9, or if it is between the character codes for a-z. If it is, we return true . If it is not, we return false . Once we have a string with only alphanumeric characters, we can reverse it and compare it to the original string to see if it is a palindrome. Click For Solution 1 Using replace with a regular expression is the easiest way to solve this challenge. export function isPalindrome(str: string): boolean { const formattedStr = str.toLocaleLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, ''); const reversedStr = formattedStr.split('').reverse().join(''); return formattedStr === reversedStr; } Explanation Take the input string and make it lowercase. Use the replace method with a regular expression to remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the string. That way we can compare the string without worrying about spaces or punctuation, such as 'racecar' and 'race car'. Store the result in a variable called formattedStr .

We first calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2 . This is called the gauss formula. We store this value in a variable called expectedSum . To be more clear, let's look at an example. If we have an array of numbers from 1 to 10, the sum of those numbers is 55. We can calculate this using the gauss formula. 10 * (10 + 1) / 2 = 55 . We can also calculate this using a for loop or the reduce method. Next, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the array. We store this value in a variable called actualSum .

Function Signature /** * Returns whether the string is a valid email address. * @param email The email address to validate. * @returns Whether the email address is valid. */ function validateEmail(email: string): boolean; Examples validateEmail(\"john@gmail.com\"); // true validateEmail(\"john@gmail\"); // false Hints If you know regular expressions, this is a great place to use them. Two solutions will be provided. One uses regular expressions and one doesn't. Solutions Click For Solution 1 Not using regular expression: export function validateEmail(email: string): boolean { if (email.indexOf('@') === -1) { return false; } const [localPart, domain] = email.split('@'); if (localPart.length === 0 || domain.length < 3) { return false; } const domainExtension = domain.split('.'); if ( domainExtension.length < 2 || domainExtension[domainExtension.length - 1].length < 2 ) { return false; } return true; } Explanation This solution is a bit complicated, but it doesn't use regular expressions. Use the indexOf method to check if the email address contains the \"@\" symbol. If it doesn't, it returns false . Use the split method to split the email address into two parts: the local part and the domain. We use destructuring to assign the two parts to variables. Check if the local part is empty or if the domain is less than three characters long. If either of these conditions is true, we return false . Split the domain into parts using the split method.

Most of the challenges that we have done so far have used loops. Loops are one of the biggest fundamentals in computer science in general. It's important that you know how to use them. For the next batch of challenges, I want to utilize some of the high order array methods in JavaScript, such as map and filter . These methods are very useful and can help you write cleaner code. Using loops is usually a bit more efficient, but the difference is negligible unless you are dealing with a very, very large data set. In everyday code, it's better to write clean code that is easy to read and understand. Most of you probably know what high order array methods are, but let's quickly go over some of the common ones before we jump into the exercises. A high order array method is a method that takes in a function as an argument or returns a function as a result. The most common high order array methods are map , filter , and reduce . There are a few others, but these are the ones that are used the most. They allow us to iterate over an array and perform some sort of operation on each element. Let's use the following array for our examples: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; Map The map method takes in a function as an argument and returns a new array with the result of calling the function on each element in the array. Here is an example: const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => { return num * 2; }); console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] In the example above, we have an array of numbers. We call the map method on the array and pass in a function as an argument. The function takes in a number as an argument and returns the number multiplied by 2. The map method then returns a new array with the result of calling the function on each element in the array. In this example each number is multiplied by 2, but you can do whatever you want in the function. Filter The filter method takes in a function as an argument and returns a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the function. Here is an example: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => { return num % 2 === 0; }); console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4] In the example above, we have an array of numbers. We call the filter method on the array and pass in a function as an argument. The function takes in a number as an argument and returns true if the number is even and false if the number is odd. The filter method then returns a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the function. In this example we filtered out all the odd numbers, but you can do whatever you want in the function. Reduce The reduce method takes in a function as an argument and returns a single value. Here is an example: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const sum = numbers.reduce((total, num) => { return total + num; }, 0); console.log(sum); // Output: 15 In the example above, we have an array of numbers. We call the reduce method on the array and pass in a function as an argument. The function takes in two arguments, total and num . The total argument is the value that we are accumulating. The num argument is the current value in the array. The function returns the sum of the total and num . The reduce method then returns a single value. forEach The forEach method takes in a function as an argument and executes the function on each element in the array. Here is an example: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; numbers.forEach((num) => { console.log(num); }); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5 In the example above, we have an array of numbers. We call the forEach method on the array and pass in a function as an argument. The function takes in a number as an argument and logs the number to the console. The forEach method executes the function on each element in the array. Here are some other high order array methods that you might see: some - returns true if at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the function every - returns true if all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the function find - returns the value of the first element in the array that passes the test implemented by the function findIndex - returns the index of the first element in the array that passes the test implemented by the function sort - sorts the elements in the array reverse - reverses the order of the elements in the array includes - returns true if the array contains a certain element","title":"What Are High Order Array Methods?"},{"location":"practice-exercises/03-01/#what-are-high-order-array-methods","text":"Most of the challenges that we have done so far have used loops.

The accumulator should be the sum of the accumulator and the car's mileage. The initial value of 0 will be used as the initial value of the accumulator. Create a variable averageMileage and initialize it to the result of dividing totalMileage by the length of the cars array. Create a variable highestMileageCar and initialize it to the result of calling the reduce method on the cars array. The accumulator should be the car with the highest mileage. The initial value of cars[0] will be used as the initial value of the accumulator. Create a variable lowestMileageCar and initialize it to the result of calling the reduce method on the cars array. The accumulator should be the car with the lowest mileage. The initial value of cars[0] will be used as the initial value of the accumulator. Return an object containing the calculated values. Round the averageMileage to 2 decimal places using the toFixed method and convert it to a number using the parseFloat method. The reduce method can be a little tough to understand, so let's break it down for the highestMileageCar variable. Here is the code again for reference: const highestMileageCar = cars.reduce( (highest, car) => (car.mileage > highest.mileage ? car : highest), cars[0] ); reduce takes two main arguments: a function and an initial value. The initial value is set to cars[0] , which is the first car in the list. The function takes two parameters: highest and car . highest initially holds the first car, and car is the next car in the list. For each car, the function compares the mileage of the current car car.mileage with the mileage of the car that was thought to be the highest so far highest.mileage . If the current car's mileage is greater, we replace the value of highest with the current car. If the current car's mileage is not greater, we stick with the car we thought was the best so far (highest). This process repeats for each car in the list. Whatever we return from the callback for the reduce method will be the new value of the accumulator.","title":"Challenge: Car Mileage Analysis"},{"location":"practice-exercises/03-08/#challenge-car-mileage-analysis","text":"","title":"Challenge: Car Mileage Analysis"},{"location":"practice-exercises/03-08/#instructions","text":"You are given an array of car objects, each containing information about a car's make, model, year, and mileage.

I know a lot of people struggle with recursion, so I'm going to try and explain it in really simple terms and we'll start off with some really simple examples and break them down. Understanding at least the basic concpet of recursion is important and it's something that is often asked about in job interviews. In programming terms, recursion is a function that calls itself until a \"base case\" or a \"base condition\" is true. In most recursive functions, we break the problem down into smaller instances and then use that solution to solve the original problem. A later example will illustrate this. When we call a function it gets added to what we call the call stack and when it comes to returning values, there's a concept called unwinding . Those are covered in the next lesson. One good example is the analogy of a Russian doll. A Russian doll is a set of wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside another. To get to the smallest doll, you have to open each doll one by one until you get to the prize or whatever is in the smallest doll or the smallest box. This is a recursive process. With the Russian doll example, you could use a for loop if you knew how many dolls there were, but if you don't know the exact number of iterations, as you often don't in programming, recursion can be a better option. Recursion vs iteration At first glance, recursion and iteration (loops) seem to be very similar. They both can be used to solve the same problems, but there are some differences between them. There are also pros and cons to both. As we've established, recursion is a function that calls itself until a base case is met and solves a smaller version of the same problem, while iteration is just a block of code that is executed a specific number of times. When using recursion, you're adding function calls to the call stack and that takes up memory and can affect performance. Iteration doesn't because you aren't adding function instances. So that's one pro for iteration over recursion. However, recursion can really minimize the amount of code needed and can be a very elegant solution and minimize complex problems. Both recursion and iteration have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the problem you're trying to solve and the code readability and efficiency you're aiming for. When to use which This really depends on the problem, the developer and many other factors, but in general: Use recursion when the problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem and you have a clear base case. Recursion is often used for problems that have a natural recursive structure, like traversing trees or finding combinations. Use iteration when you need to repeat a block of code a specific number of times or until a condition is met. Iteration is generally simpler to implement and understand for simple repetitive tasks. Code example Let's look at a simple example of recursion: function countDown(num: number): void { // Base case if (num <= 0) { console.log('All done!'); return; } // Recursive case console.log(num); num--; countDown(num); } countDown(3); In this example, we have a function called countDown that takes in a number. We have what we call the base case , which is when the number is less than or equal to 0. If this is true, we log \"All done!\" and return. If it is not true, we run the recursive case , which will log the number, subtract 1 from it, and then call the function again with the new number.

In this lesson, we will look at a key concept in recursion called \"unwinding\". We know that when we run a function recursively, it calls itself until it reaches a base case. After it reaches that base it then starts returning values as it \"unwinds\" the recursion. The order in which the function calls are returned is the reverse order of the function calls. This is because the function calls are added to the call stack, which is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure. We're actually going to look at stacks and other data structures later. In fact we will create our own implementation of a stack. We explain the basics now though so that you can understand how recursion and unwinding work. Let's look at an example of this. Consider the following function: function sumUpTo(n: number): number { if (n === 0 || n === 1) { return n; } return n + sumUpTo(n - 1); } This function uses recursion to calculate the sum of positive integers up to n . For example, if the input is 5, the function should return 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5). Let's see how this function works. When we call sumUpTo(5) , it executes sumUpTo(4) + 5 . Now, sumUpTo(4) calls sumUpTo(3) + 4 . Continuing, sumUpTo(3) calls sumUpTo(2) + 3 . In the next call, sumUpTo(2) calls sumUpTo(1) + 2 . Finally, sumUpTo(1) returns 1. Now, we can start \"unwinding\" the recursion and adding the numbers to form the sum: sumUpTo(1) returns 1 sumUpTo(2) returns 1 + 2 = 3 sumUpTo(3) returns 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 sumUpTo(4) returns 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 sumUpTo(5) returns 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 As you can see, the function starts returning values as it \"unwinds\" the recursion. It returns in the reverse order of the function calls, which is why it's called \"unwinding\". A Look At The Call Stack As mentioned above, the call stack is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure, which means that the last function that was added to the call stack is the first one to be removed. This is why the function calls are returned in the reverse order of the function calls. When we first call sumUpTo(5) , it is added to the call stack. Then, sumUpTo(4) is added to the call stack and so on... Once sumUpTo(1) is called, it returns 1 and is removed from the call stack. Then, sumUpTo(2) returns 3 and is removed from the call stack. This continues until sumUpTo(5) returns 15 and is removed from the call stack. We can see this by logging the function calls and the return values: function sumUpTo(n: number): number { if (n === 0 || n === 1) { console.log(`sumUpTo(${n}) returns ${n}`); return n; } console.log(`sumUpTo(${n}) calls sumUpTo(${n - 1}) + ${n}`); const result = n + sumUpTo(n - 1); console.log(`sumUpTo(${n}) returns ${result}`); return result; }","title":"Unwinding"},{"location":"practice-exercises/04-02/#unwinding","text":"We talked about the basics of recursion and looked at a simple example in the last lesson.

Consider the following function: function sumUpTo(n: number): number { if (n === 0 || n === 1) { return n; } return n + sumUpTo(n - 1); } This function uses recursion to calculate the sum of positive integers up to n . For example, if the input is 5, the function should return 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5). Let's see how this function works. When we call sumUpTo(5) , it executes sumUpTo(4) + 5 . Now, sumUpTo(4) calls sumUpTo(3) + 4 . Continuing, sumUpTo(3) calls sumUpTo(2) + 3 . In the next call, sumUpTo(2) calls sumUpTo(1) + 2 . Finally, sumUpTo(1) returns 1. Now, we can start \"unwinding\" the recursion and adding the numbers to form the sum: sumUpTo(1) returns 1 sumUpTo(2) returns 1 + 2 = 3 sumUpTo(3) returns 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 sumUpTo(4) returns 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 sumUpTo(5) returns 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 As you can see, the function starts returning values as it \"unwinds\" the recursion. It returns in the reverse order of the function calls, which is why it's called \"unwinding\".","title":"Unwinding"},{"location":"practice-exercises/04-02/#a-look-at-the-call-stack","text":"As mentioned above, the call stack is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure, which means that the last function that was added to the call stack is the first one to be removed. This is why the function calls are returned in the reverse order of the function calls. When we first call sumUpTo(5) , it is added to the call stack. Then, sumUpTo(4) is added to the call stack and so on... Once sumUpTo(1) is called, it returns 1 and is removed from the call stack. Then, sumUpTo(2) returns 3 and is removed from the call stack. This continues until sumUpTo(5) returns 15 and is removed from the call stack. We can see this by logging the function calls and the return values: function sumUpTo(n: number): number { if (n === 0 || n === 1) { console.log(`sumUpTo(${n}) returns ${n}`); return n; } console.log(`sumUpTo(${n}) calls sumUpTo(${n - 1}) + ${n}`); const result = n + sumUpTo(n - 1); console.log(`sumUpTo(${n}) returns ${result}`); return result; }","title":"A Look At The Call Stack"},{"location":"practice-exercises/04-03/","text":"Challenge: Reverse String Recursion Instructions Write a function called reverseString that takes in a string and returns the reversed version of the string.

Solutions Click For Solution export function reverseString(str: string): string { if (str === '') { return ''; } return reverseString(str.substring(1)) + str.charAt(0); } Explanation The reverseString function uses recursion to reverse the string. If the input string is empty ( str === '' ), return an empty string ( '' ). Otherwise, call itself with the substring starting from the second character ( str.substr(1) ) and concatenate the first character of the original string at the end ( str[0] ). For example, if the input is 'hello' , the function first calls itself with 'ello' and concatenates 'h' at the end. Then it calls itself with 'llo' and concatenates 'e' at the end. This process continues until the input becomes an empty string, and then the function starts concatenating the characters in reverse order, resulting in the reversed string 'olleh' . It is important to have that base case of an empty string, otherwise the function will continue to call itself with substrings of the original string until it runs out of memory and crashes. More Explanation Let's break it down a little more... When we call reverseString('hello') , it executes reverseString('ello') + 'h' . Now, reverseString('ello') calls reverseString('llo') + 'e' . Continuing, reverseString('llo') calls reverseString('lo') + 'l' . In the next call, reverseString('lo') calls reverseString('o') + 'l' . Finally, reverseString('o') returns 'o' .

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the sequence starts with 0 and 1, and then each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

So we have done quite a few challenges. I want to talk a little bit about concepts such as time complexity, runtime, space complexity and Big O notation. This is stuff that you may be asked about in a technical interview, so it's important to at least have a basic understanding of it. Don't get overwhelmed. If you don't understand some of this stuff right away, that's okay. It's a lot to take in. There are several different types of time complexity. I am going to go over the most common ones in this course. Runtime vs Time Complexity When we talk about runtime , runtime pertains to how long it takes for a function to run. We can measure this in seconds, milliseconds, or any other unit of time. When we talk about time complexity , we're talking about how the runtime scales as the input grows. So when we analyze the time complexity of a function, we're essentially trying to understand how the function's runtime will change and increase as the input size increases. This provides us with insight into how efficient the function or algorithm is. So if we pass in 1 number as the input, whats the increase in runtime if we pass in 100 or 1,000 or 1,000,000 numbers. That's what time complexity is. We measure in time complexity, which is more abstract over straight runtime because runtime can vary based on many factors like hardware, system load, how the function was written, etc. Time complexity is often expressed in terms of \"Big O\" notation, which describes the upper bound of the number of basic operations performed by the algorithm relative to the size of the input. The \"O\" in \"Big O\" stands for \"Order of\". We'll talk more about Big O notation in the next lesson. As I said, there are several types of time complexity, but we are going to focus on 4 of the most common ones: Constant Time Linear Time Quadratic Time Logarithmic Time Let's look at a chart to help us visualize these different types of time complexity. We are going to go through most of these by example, but for now, I'll give you a quick explanation of each one. Constant Time Complexity Constant time is when the runtime is always the same, no matter how big the input is. So if the input, meaning the function parameter is 1 number or 1 million numbers, the runtime will always be around the same. If we look at the chart, we can see that the constant line is flat. So the runtime is constant. It doesn't matter how big the input is. The runtime will always be around the same. This is the most efficient type of time complexity, however achieving constant time complexity is not usually possible due to the nature of computation and is typically associated with simple operations or data structures that can be accessed directly in a single step. Linear Time Complexity Linear time is when the runtime scales linearly as the input grows. So if the input is 1 number, the runtime will be 1 step. If the input is 1 million numbers, the runtime will be 1 million steps. That's why the orange line is a straight line in the chart. As the input grows, the runtime grows at the same rate. I would say linear is the most common type of complexity that you'll see. It accounts for about 95% or more of the challeneges that we've done in this course. As far as efficiency, it is fairly efficient as it's a one to one growth. It's more efficient than quadratic time complexity, which we'll talk about next. Quadratic Time Complexity Quadratic time is when the runtime scales quadratically as the input grows. \u201cQuadratic\u201d is the fancy adjective used to describe squaring, or raising to the power of 2. So if the input size is 1, the runtime is 1 step. If the input size is 10, the runtime is 100 steps. If the input size is 100, the runtime is 10,000 steps. And so on. If we look at the chart, we can see that the quadratic line is a curve. So the runtime is growing at a much faster rate compared to linear growth. This is not very efficient. We want to avoid quadratic time complexity if possible. Logarithmic Time Complexity Logarithmic time is when the runtime scales logarithmically as the input grows. So as the input size increases, the time taken by the algorithm increases, but at a much slower rate compared to linear or quadratic growth. Mathematically, a logarithm is the inverse function or the opposite of an exponent. So if we have 2 to the power of 3, the logarithm is 3. If we have 2 to the power of 4, the logarithm is 4. If we have 2 to the power of 5, the logarithm is 5. And so on. If we look at the chart, we can see that the logarithmic line is almost flat. It does increase but at a much slower rate. So any function or algorithm that uses logarithmic time is very efficient. In the next lesson, I want to talk about Big O notation and how we can use it to describe the time complexity of a function.","title":"What Is Time Complexity?"},{"location":"practice-exercises/05-01/#what-is-time-complexity","text":"So we have done quite a few challenges.

We won't get deep into the math here. We will just point out how to recognize the different types of time complexity and how to describe them in Big O notation. Constant Time Complexity \u2014 O(1) Constant time is when the runtime is always the same, no matter how big the input is. 0(1) is the notation for constant time. It's pronounced \"O of 1\" or \"big O of 1\". Linear Time Complexity \u2014 O(n) Linear time is when the runtime scales linearly as the input grows. O(n) is the notation for linear time. It's pronounced \"O of n\" or \"big O of n\". Quadratic Time Complexity \u2014 O(n^2) Quadratic time is when the runtime scales quadratically as the input grows. O(n^2) is the notation for quadratic time. It's pronounced \"O of n squared\" or \"big O of n squared\". Logarithmic Time Complexity \u2014 O(log n) Logarithmic time is when the runtime scales logarithmically as the input grows. O(log n) is the notation for logarithmic time. It's pronounced \"O of log n\" or \"big O of log n\". Exponential Time Complexity \u2014 O(2^n) Exponential time is when the runtime scales exponentially as the input grows. O(2^n) is the notation for exponential time. It's pronounced \"O of 2 to the n\" or \"big O of 2 to the n\". Factorial Time Complexity \u2014 O(n!) Factorial time is when the runtime scales factorially as the input grows. O(n!) is the notation for factorial time. It's pronounced \"O of n factorial\" or \"big O of n factorial\". Array operations and time complexity Just about every operation in your code has some kind of time complexity, not just entire functions or algorithms. Time complexity refers to how the execution time of an operation scales as the size of the data it operates on increases. This concept doesn't only apply to complete functions with input parameters but also to the individual actions performed on data structures like arrays. So let's go over the different operations of an array and their time complexity. Accessing elements by index (read): O(1) - Accessing an element by its index is a constant-time operation because arrays use contiguous memory blocks, allowing direct access to elements. So no matter how big the array is, it will always take the same amount of time to access an element by its index. The input doesn't always have to be just a function argument. In this case, the input is the index. Insertion and deletion at the end: O(1) - If you add or remove elements at the end of the array, it is usually a constant-time operation because there is no need to shift or reorganize other elements. in this case the input is the array size and the specific element being inserted or deleted. Insertion and deletion at the beginning: O(n) - Adding or removing elements at the beginning of the array requires shifting all existing elements to make space for the new element, which takes linear time. Insertion and deletion in the middle: O(n) - Similarly, adding or removing elements in the middle of the array requires shifting elements, resulting in a linear time complexity. Searching for an element: O(n) - In the worst case, searching for an element in an unsorted array requires checking each element, which takes linear time. You basically are searching one by one. Searching for an element with binary search (only applicable to sorted arrays): O(log n) - If the array is sorted, you can perform binary search, which has a logarithmic time complexity. This is very efficient. We'll talk more about binary search in a later lesson. You basically split the sorted array in half and eliminate the half that doesn't include the element you're looking for. Then you split in half again and eliminate until you find the element. Again, the array has to be sorted for this. So now that you know about the main time complexities and Big O notation, in the next lesson, we'll give you can example of constant time.","title":"Big O Notation"},{"location":"practice-exercises/05-02/#big-o-notation","text":"We talked about time complexity in the last lesson.

As the input size increases, the runtime of the algorithm increases, but at a much slower rate compared to linear or quadratic time complexities. In a logarithmic time algorithm, the number of operations scales logarithmically with the input size. Logarithmic time complexity is denoted by Big O notation as O(log n) or \"O of log n\", where n represents the size of the input. Example: Logarithmic Time Complexity Function Consider a function called findPower that calculates the power of a number using recursion. The function takes two parameters: base - the base number. exponent - the exponent to which the base is raised. We will be using recursion in this example, which we learned about in the last section. function findPower(base: number, exponent: number): number { if (exponent === 0) { return 1; } if (exponent % 2 === 0) { const halfPower = findPower(base, exponent / 2); return halfPower * halfPower; } else { const halfPower = findPower(base, (exponent - 1) / 2); return base * halfPower * halfPower; } } In the findPower function, we use recursion to efficiently calculate the power of a number. The function exploits the property that any number raised to an even exponent can be split into two halves, and the result is the square of the number raised to half the exponent. For odd exponents, the function reduces the exponent by 1 and repeats the process. Efficiency and Best Use Cases Logarithmic time complexity is highly efficient and desirable for large datasets or problems that can be divided into smaller sub-problems. It is often encountered in algorithms that utilize divide-and-conquer strategies or binary search, which we will talk about soon when we get to data structures and algorithms. In the example of findPower , the algorithm efficiently computes the power of a number by reducing the number of multiplications required, making it ideal for calculations with large exponents. Testing the Runtime Testing the runtime of logarithmic time algorithms can be done with larger input sizes and observing the relatively slow growth of runtime compared to linear or quadratic algorithms. However, keep in mind that logarithmic time algorithms are already highly efficient, and the difference in runtime for moderately large input sizes may not be significant. Try running this code: console.time('Find Power 1'); findPower(2, 100); console.timeEnd('Find Power 1'); console.time('Find Power 2'); findPower(2, 1000000000); console.timeEnd('Find Power 2'); The result that I got is: Find Power 1: 0.048ms Find Power 2: 0.005ms The runtime for findPower with an exponent of 1 billion is slightly faster than the runtime for an exponent of 100.

Space complexity refers to the amount of memory or storage space that an algorithm or function consumes based on the size of its input. It measures how the memory usage of an algorithm scales with the size of the input data. The goal is to optimize memory usage and minimize the additional memory required during the execution of an algorithm or program. There are a lot of similarities between time and space complexity. We can use the same Big O notation to describe space complexity. We have constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, and factorial space complexity. In many cases, the space complexity of a function will be the same as the time complexity. If a function takes O(n) time, it will also take O(n) space. If a function takes O(n^2) time, it will also take O(n^2) space. This is because the amount of memory used by a function is often directly related to the number of operations it performs. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes a function will take up more memory than time, or vice versa. Rules for Calculating Space Complexity Variables and data structures take up space: When you declare variables or use data structures (arrays, objects, etc.) in your code, they occupy memory space based on their size and data type. The space complexity increases with the number and size of variables and data structures used in your program. Function calls take up space: Whenever you call a function, the program needs to allocate memory for the function call stack, which includes function arguments, local variables, return addresses, and other bookkeeping information. Each function call adds to the space complexity, and if you have nested function calls or recursive functions, it can lead to a significant increase in space usage. The space complexity of a function is the sum of the space complexities of all the variables, data structures, and function calls inside the function: This means that to calculate the space complexity of a function, you need to consider all the variables and data structures used within the function and their space requirements. Additionally, if the function makes any recursive or nested function calls, you need to account for the space used by those function calls as well. Examples of Space Complexity Let's take a look at some examples: Constant Space O(1) function add(num1: number, num2: number): number { return num1 + num2; } The space complexity of this function is constant . The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that depend on the input size. It simply returns the result of the addition, so the amount of memory used by the function does not change with the input size. We can describe this function as O(1) in Big O notation. Linear Space O(n) function createArray(num: number): number[] { const arr = []; for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) { arr.push(i); } return arr; } The space complexity of the function createArray(num) is linear . This is because the function creates an array and pushes elements into it using the for-loop. As the input num increases, the size of the array also increases proportionally. Therefore, the space complexity of the function grows linearly with the input. We can describe this function as O(n) in Big O notation. Quadratic Space O(n^2) function createMatrix(num: number): number[][] { const matrix = []; for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) { matrix[i] = []; for (let j = 0; j < num; j++) { matrix[i][j] = i + j; } } return matrix; } The space complexity of the function createMatrix(num) is quadratic . This is because the function creates a two-dimensional array and fills it with values using the nested for-loops. As the input num increases, the size of the matrix also increases proportionally. Therefore, the space complexity of the function grows quadratically with the input. We can describe this function as O(n^2) in Big O notation. Logarithmic Space O(log n) function findPower(base: number, exponent: number): number { if (exponent === 0) { return 1; } if (exponent % 2 === 0) { const halfPower = findPower(base, exponent / 2); return halfPower * halfPower; } else { const halfPower = findPower(base, (exponent - 1) / 2); return base * halfPower * halfPower; } } The space complexity of the function findPower(base, exponent) is logarithmic . This is because the function uses recursion to calculate the power of a number. As the input exponent increases, the number of recursive calls increases logarithmically. Therefore, the space complexity of the function grows logarithmically with the input. We can describe this function as O(log n) in Big O notation. In these examples, the time and space complexity are the same. However, this is not always the case. Let's look at an example where the space complexity is different from the time complexity. Constant Time O(1) and Linear Space O(n) function findSum(arr: number[]): number { let sum = 0; for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { sum += arr[i]; } return sum; } The time complexity of the function findSum(arr) is linear or O(n) , where n is the length of the input array arr . This is because the function uses a loop to iterate through each element of the array and perform a constant-time operation (adding the element to the sum). The number of iterations is directly proportional to the size of the array. The space complexity of the function is O(1) , which is constant . This is because the function only uses a single variable sum to store the result. The space used by the variable does not depend on the size of the input array, so it remains constant regardless of the input size.","title":"What Is Space Complexity?"},{"location":"practice-exercises/05-07/#what-is-space-complexity","text":"Space complexity refers to the amount of memory or storage space that an algorithm or function consumes based on the size of its input.

It involves maintaining a \"window\" that slides through an array or string, allowing you to track and process a subset of elements without the need for nested loops. This technique can be used to maximize the time complexity of your algorithms. In the last exercise, we did a subarray sum algorithm that used nested for loops and had a time and space complexity of O(n^2), which is not very efficient. In the next exercise, we're going to refactor that solution and make it linear O(n) by using this sliding window technique. This technique provides an example of doing the same thing but improving efficiency and complexity. How it Works Let's explore how this works: Initialize Variables: Set up two pointers, usually named left and right , to define the boundaries of the sliding window. Additionally, you might need variables to store the current state, like sums or frequencies. For our example, we'll need a currentSum and maxSum Initial Window: We start by positioning the window at the beginning of the array or string and calculate the initial state or value based on the elements within the window. Since we're getting the sum of k elements, we'll start with a window of k elements. In this example k , or the window size, is 3 . Slide the Window: We'll move the right pointer to the right, expanding the window by one element. Update the state or value based on the newly added element. In our case, we would calculate the new sum with the new element. Adjust the Window: Depending on specific conditions or constraints, you might need to shrink or adjust the window by moving the left pointer to the right, thus excluding an element from the window. Again, update the state accordingly. Repeat: Continue sliding and adjusting the window until the right pointer reaches the end of the array or string. During this process, keep track of the desired information (maximum/minimum, frequency, substring, etc.). Advantages Optimized Time Complexity: Sliding window reduces the time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations. It's particularly beneficial for situations where brute-force solutions would require nested loops. Space Efficiency: The technique doesn't require storing all individual subarrays or substrings, reducing memory usage. Simplicity: Once understood, sliding window problems often become easier to solve compared to their naive counterparts. Notes Sliding window is best suited for problems that involve contiguous subarrays or substrings. The technique can have variations such as dynamic window size or two-pointer sliding.

Now that we've done some challenges and looked at time complexity and Big O notation, let's look at data structures. Data structures are used in every programming language. All a data structure is is a way of storing and organizing data so that it can be used effectively. They're not only used for storing data but they're also used for accessing and manipulating data. If we have a list of 1,000 items, and we want to find a specific item in that list, we can use a data structure to store the data in a way that makes it easy to find the item we're looking for. Built-In Data Structures Every language has data structures built in. JavaScript has arrays and objects as well as maps and sets. Python has lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Java has arrays, lists, maps, and sets. And so on. We will look at data structures from a JavaScript/TypeScript perspective, but the concepts are the same no matter what language you're using. More Targeted Data Structures In addition to the built-in data structures, we have more targeted structures that work in a specific way. When look at an array in TypeScript, it can be used in many different ways using all types of methods and properties. A linked list, on the other hand, is a very specific data structure that has a very specific way of working. It's not as flexible as an array, but it's more efficient in certain situations. When creating a linked list or a stack or a queue, we can use a TypeScript array as the base and then only expose specific methods and properties that make sense for that data structure. This is what we'll be doing in this course. You probably haven't seen a linked list used in everyday code very often. You've seen arrays and objects as they're built in and very flexible. Linked lists can be used in certain situations where they're more efficient than arrays. Also, data structures are a huge topic when it comes to technical interviews. You may be asked to implement a linked list or a stack or a queue in an interview. You may also be asked to use a specific data structure to solve a problem. So, it's important to know how they work and when to use them. Data Structures and Algorithms Data structures and algorithms go hand in hand. An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem. You can look at the exercises that we've done so far as algorithms. A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data so that it can be used effectively. We've used arrays, objects and maps in the challenges that we've done so far. Now we will create our own custom classes that implement specific data structures. We'll start with some built-in data structures like maps and sets as well as a custom hash table. Then we'll move to stacks, queues, linked lists and some of the more difficult structures like trees and graphs. We can then use these data structures to solve problems. Common Data Structures These are some of the most common data structures that you'll see in programming. We'll be looking at each of these in this course. Arrays Objects Maps Sets Stacks Queues Linked Lists Trees Binary Trees Binary Search Trees (BST) Graphs Hash Tables Linear vs Non-Linear Data Structures Data structures can be linear or non-linear. A linear data structure is a structure where data is organized sequentially, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent element. Some examples are arrays, stacks, queues and linked lists. A non-linear data structure is a structure where data is not organized sequentially. Some examples are trees and graphs. We'll be looking at both linear and non-linear data structures in this course. In the next lesson, we'll look at hash tables, including maps and sets.","title":"What Are Data Structures?"},{"location":"practice-exercises/06-01/#what-are-data-structures","text":"Now that we've done some challenges and looked at time complexity and Big O notation, let's look at data structures.

A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, where the desired value can be found along with its index. Here is a visual representation of a hash table: We have our keys on the left, which are names of people, and we have our stored values on the right, which in this case, are their phone numbers. In the middle is the hash function. Hash Function A hash function is a function that takes in a key and returns an index. The index is used to determine where the key-value pair should be stored in the hash table. The hash function should always return the same index for the same key. Hash Collisions There is something called a hash collision that can occur when using hash tables. A collision occurs when two keys are mapped to the same index in the array. A good hash function will evenly distribute the keys across the hash table. This will minimize collisions and improve the time complexity of the hash table, which we'll discuss shortly. Hash Tables in TypeScript Hash tables are used in many different languages. In TypeScript, there are actually some built in structures that use hash tables. For example, an object is an example of a hash table because data is represented in key-value pairs. There are also Map and Set data structures that use hash tables. In this section, we will do some challenges that use maps and sets, but we will also learn how to implement a hash table from scratch. Time & Space Complexity When it comes to time complexity, hash tables are a great data structure for fast lookups. The average time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions is O(1). Collisions can slow down the time complexity to O(n). Space complexity is O(n) because we have to store all of the keys and values in the hash table and the size of the hash table is proportional to the number of keys and values. Operation Time Complexity Space Complexity Access O(1) O(n) Search O(1) O(n) Insertion O(1) O(n) Deletion O(1) O(n) Hash Methods Here are some of the methods that are available on a hash table: set(key, value) - Adds a key-value pair to the hash table. get(key) - Returns the value associated with a key. remove(key) - Removes a key-value pair from the hash table. has(key) - Returns true if the key exists in the hash table, false otherwise. keys() - Returns an array of all the keys in the hash table. values() - Returns an array of all the values in the hash table.

In JavaScript, a map is a collection of key-value pairs. Maps are also known as dictionaries, hashmaps, and associative arrays in other programming languages. Maps are used to store data in a way that uniquely identifies each element in the collection. This is done by using a key, which is a unique identifier for a single element in the collection. The key is used to retrieve the associated value. Maps vs Objects Maps are similar to objects in that both let you associate a value with a key, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Objects are used more because they have been around longer, but maps are preferred in certain cases. The biggest difference between maps and objects is that maps allow keys of any type, while objects only allow strings, numbers, and symbols as keys. This means that maps can use functions, objects, and any primitive type as a key. Maps can also have better performance in scenarios involving frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs. On the other hand, objects have better performance for the case of looking up key-value pairs. Creating a Map To create a map, we use the new keyword and the Map() constructor. Let's create a map called nameMap : const nameMap = new Map(); We can also pass an array of arrays to the Map() constructor. The first element in each sub-array will be the key, and the second element will be the value. We can create a map with some key-value pairs like this: const nameMap = new Map([ [1, 'John'], [2, 'Jane'], [3, 'Joe'], ]); Let's log the map: console.log(nameMap); We can see that the map has three key-value pairs. The keys are the numbers 1, 2, and 3, and the values are the strings 'John', 'Jane', and 'Joe'. Notice that this example uses numbers as keys. We can use any type of data as a key, including objects and functions. Let's create a map with some different types of keys: const myFunction = (): void => {}; const emptyObj = {}; const map2 = new Map([ ['name', 'John'], [1, 'number one'], [true, 'really true'], [null, 'null'], [myFunction, 'some function'], [emptyObj, 'empty object'], ]); Retrieving Data To retrieve data from a map, we use the get() method. Let's retrieve the value associated with the key 1 from the nameMap map: console.log(nameMap.get(1)); // John Let's get the function and the object values from the map2 map: console.log(map2.get(myFunction)); console.log(map2.get(emptyObj)); Setting Data To set data in a map, we use the set() method. Let's set some new key-value pairs in the nameMap map: nameMap.set(4, 'Jack'); nameMap.set(5, 'Jill'); Let's log the map: console.log(nameMap); // Map(5) { 1 => 'John', 2 => 'Jane', 3 => 'Joe', 4 => 'Jack', 5 => 'Jill' } Checking if a Key Exists To check if a key exists in a map, we use the has() method. Let's check if the key 1 exists in the nameMap map: console.log(nameMap.has(1)); // true console.log(nameMap.has(6)); // false Deleting Data To delete data from a map, we use the delete() method. Let's delete the key-value pair with the key 1 from the nameMap map: nameMap.delete(1); console.log(nameMap.has(1)); // false Getting the Size of a Map To get the size of a map, we use the size property.

Let's loop through the nameMap map and log each key-value pair: for (const [key, value] of nameMap) { console.log(key, value); } You can also use the forEach() method to loop through a map. Let's log each key-value pair using the forEach() method: nameMap.forEach((value, key) => { console.log(key, value); }); You can also get all of the keys or values from a map using the keys() and values() methods.

This is not going to be a very advanced implementation. Implementations can get much more complex as they handle collisions better and dynamically resize, but this will be a good starting point. Class & constructor Start by creating a HashTable class and then add some methods to it. export class HashTable<T> { private storage: [string, T][][] = []; private limit: number; constructor(limit = 14) { this.limit = limit; } } The constructor will take in a limit parameter, which will be the size of the hash table. Set a default value of 14, but we can change that when we create a new instance of the HashTable class. Also initialize a storage array, which will be the hash table. Set it to an empty array for now. hash function Next, create a hash function. This will take in a key and return an index. The point of hashing is to get a unique index for each key. There are all kinds of hashing algorithms that can be used such as MD5 , SHA-1 , SHA-256 , etc. We are going to use a very simple hashing algorithm that will just add up the character codes of each character in the key and then return the sum modulo the size of the hash table. This isn't the best hash function because it can cause collisions, which happen when two different keys get the same hash. But we'll not make this too advanced for purposes of the exercise. private hash(key: string, max: number): number { let hash = 0; for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) { hash += key.charCodeAt(i); } return hash % max; } It takes in a key, which will be the key that we will pass into the set function when we create it. It will also take in a max, which will be the size of the hash table. Start by initializing a hash variable to 0. Then loop through each character in the key and add the character code to the hash. Each character has a character code. You can get the character code of a character by using the charCodeAt() method. Add the character code to the hash each time through the loop. Then return the hash modulo the max, which is the size of the hash table. The reason for this is to make sure that the hash is within the range of the hash table. By using the modulo operator, the result will stay in range because the result will always be less than the max. print Method Create a very simple method that just logs the table. You probably wouldn't want to do this in a real application, but it will be useful for us to see what is going on. printTable(): void { console.log(this.storage); } If you instantiate a new HashTable and call the print() method, you will see an empty array. const ht = new HashTable(); ht.printTable(); // [] set Method Let's create a method to add a key-value pair to the hash table. This will take in a key and a value. We will use the hash() function to get the index where we will store the key-value pair. set(key: string, value: T): void { const index = this.hash(key, this.limit); if (this.storage[index] === undefined) { this.storage[index] = [[key, value]]; } else { let inserted = false; for (let i = 0; i < this.storage[index].length; i++) { if (this.storage[index][i][0] === key) { this.storage[index][i][1] = value; inserted = true; } } if (inserted === false) { this.storage[index].push([key, value]); } } } This method will take in a key and a value. First, we get the index by passing in the key and the limit to the hash() function. Next, we do a little collision handling. Instead of just storing the key-value pair, we first check to see if there is already something stored at that index. If there is nothing there, we just store the key-value pair in an array at that index. If it is not empty, we will loop through the array at that index and check if the key already exists. If it does, we will update the value. If it doesn't, we will push the key-value pair to the array. Let's test it out. const ht = new HashTable(8); ht.set(\"john\", \"555-234-3544\"); ht.set(\"james\", \"555-384-5523\"); ht.set(\"jack\", \"555-384-9933\"); ht.set(\"jill\", \"555-390-0034\"); ht.printTable(); You should see something like this: [ [ [ 'james', '555-384-5523' ] ], [ [ 'jack', '555-384-9933' ] ], <1 empty item>, [ [ 'jill', '555-390-0034' ] ], <3 empty items>, [ [ 'john', '555-234-3544' ] ] ] Remember this image? It looks very similar to what we have done here. We have an array with 8 items. We have 4 items in the array and 4 empty items. The items in the array are also arrays. Each of those arrays has a key-value pair inside of it. The key is the name and the value is the phone number. get Method Now let's create a method to get a value from the hash table. This will take in a key and return the value. get(key: string): T | undefined { const index = this.hash(key, this.limit); if (this.storage[index] === undefined) { return undefined; } else { for (let i = 0; i < this.storage[index].length; i++) { if (this.storage[index][i][0] === key) { return this.storage[index][i][1]; } } } return undefined; } First, we get the index by passing in the key and the limit to the hash() function. Then we check if the index is empty. If it is, we will return undefined . If it is not empty, we will loop through the array at that index and check if the key exists. If it does, we will return the value. Let's test it out. const ht = new HashTable(8); ht.set(\"john\", \"555-234-3544\"); ht.set(\"james\", \"555-384-5523\"); ht.set(\"jack\", \"555-384-9933\"); ht.set(\"jill\", \"555-390-0034\"); console.log(ht.get(\"jill\")); // 555-390-0034 console.log(ht.get(\"jack\")); // 555-384-9933 console.log(ht.get(\"james\")); // 555-384-5523 console.log(ht.get(\"john\")); // 555-234-3544 You should get the following: 555 - 390 - 0034; 555 - 384 - 9933; 555 - 384 - 5523; 555 - 234 - 3544; remove Method Now let's create a method to remove a key-value pair from the hash table. This will take in a key and remove the key-value pair. remove(key: string): void { const index = this.hash(key, this.limit); if (this.storage[index]) { if ( this.storage[index].length === 1 && this.storage[index][0][0] === key ) { delete this.storage[index]; } else { for (let i = 0; i < this.storage[index].length; i++) { if (this.storage[index][i][0] === key) { delete this.storage[index][i]; } } } } } First, we get the index by passing in the key and the limit to the hash() function. Then we check if the bucket exists. Then we check if the key matches the key at the index and there is only one item in the bucket, delete the bucket, otherwise loop through the bucket and delete the item that matches the key. You should get something like the following: [ [ [ 'james', '555-384-5523' ] ], <1 empty item>, [ [ 'jill', '555-390-0034' ] ], <3 empty items> ] getValues Method Now let's create a method to get all the values from the hash table. This will return an array of all the values. getValues() { const values = []; for (let i = 0; i < this.storage.length; i++) { if (this.storage[i]) { for (let j = 0; j < this.storage[i].length; j++) { values.push(this.storage[i][j][1]); } } } return values; } Let's test it out. console.log(ht.getValues()); // [ '555-234-3544', '555-384-5523', '555-384-9933', '555-390-0034' ] Conclusion That's it!

This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack. Think of a stack of plates. The last plate added to the stack will be the first plate removed from the stack. To give you a better idea, we can look at this image: In this case, each element is just a number, but it could be anything. We start with a stack with 1 element, we push another one on labeled 2. After that, another one labeled 3, and so on. In this case, the last element added to the stack is 5. We use the term push when we add on top of the stack. If we want to remove an element from the stack, we remove the last one added, which is 5. We can't remove 3 or 2 or 1. We can only remove 5. Once we remove 5, we can then remove 4, 3, 2, and 1. The term for removing from the top of the stack is pop . We know that in TypeScript, Arrays have a push and pop method. We can use an array as a stack. We can also create our own stack class that only exposes the push and pop methods or we can create our own push and pop methods via a class. Call Stack A great example of a stack is the call stack. The call stack is a fundamental concept in programming and serves as an execution context for function calls. The JavaScript engine in the browser has a call stack. In fact, you can view it in your browser dev tools. It is a stack data structure that keeps track of function calls in the order they are made and allows for their orderly execution and return. When a function is called, a new frame is added to the top of the call stack. This frame contains information such as the function's arguments, local variables, and the position in the code where the function was called from. The function's execution begins, and if it calls other functions, their frames are added on top of the stack, forming a stack of nested function calls as you can see here. The call stack can be used to debug code and find issues. In the next lesson, we will create our own stack class.","title":"Stack"},{"location":"practice-exercises/07-01/#stack","text":"A stack is a linear data structure that works in a specific way and that is Last In, First Out or LIFO .

We will create a Stack class that has methods such as push , pop and peek . Stack Class & Constructor Let's start by creating a class named Stack . We'll add a property called maxSize and set it to 100. This is the maximum number of elements that can be in the stack. We'll also add a property called stack and set it to an empty array. This is where we'll store the elements in the stack. Finally, we'll add a property called top and set it to -1 . This is the index of the top element in the stack. We are using -1 because the stack is empty. The first element will be at index 0. export class Stack<T> { readonly maxSize = 100; private stack: T[] = []; private top = -1; } push Method Create the push method to add to the stack. It will take in a value (or element). First, check if the stack is full. If it is, return false . Increment the top index by 1 . Set the element at the top index of the stack to the value. Return true . push(value: T): boolean { if (this.isFull()) { return false; } this.top++; this.stack[this.top] = value; return true; } isFull Method Of course we need to add the method to check if the stack is full. It will return true if the top index is equal to the maximum size minus 1. Otherwise, it will return false . isFull(): boolean { return this.top === this.maxSize - 1; } Let's also add a method to check if the stack is empty.

Create a new instance of the Stack class. Push a few elements to the stack. Then, log the stack to the console. const stack = new Stack(); stack.push(1); stack.push(2); stack.push(3); console.log(stack); You should see something like this: Stack { maxSize: 100, stack: [ 1, 2, 3 ], top: 2 } pop Method Now let's create the pop method. It will remove the top element from the stack. It is important to know that pop and just about any method of any structure can be implemented in many ways. Sometimes the actual data will not be removed from the array (this.stack). It will just go by what is in the top of the stack. I want the actual data to be removed, so I will use the built in pop method on the array. First, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return undefined . Then decrement the top by 1 and then return the result from this.stack.pop() . pop(): T | undefined { if (this.isEmpty()) { return undefined; } this.top--; return this.stack.pop(); } peek Method Finally, let's create the peek method.

Each node contains a value and a pointer . A pointer can mean a lot of different things in programming, in the case of a linked list, it is a reference to another node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head . The last node in the list is called the tail . The tail's pointer will be undefined to indicate that it is the last node in the list. We looked at a queue, which also has a head and a tail, but they serve different purposes. In a queue, the head refers to the front of the queue, where elements are dequeued (removed) from and the tail is where elements are enqueued (added). In a linked list, the head refers to the first node in the list and the tail refers to the last node and its pointer is always undefined . Elements can be added or removed from both the head and the tail. As you can see in this image, we have a linked list with 4 nodes. Each node has a number as the value and a pointer that points to the next node. The last node or the tail has a pointer that is undefined . Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node in a linked list contains a pointer to the next node. This can be very efficient in certain ways, such as inserting and deleting data. It just involves changing a few pointers and can have an O(1) time complexity. However, there are also use cases where they're not very efficient. Just know that the basic building block of a linked list is the node, which typically contains two parts: Data : It holds the value or payload that represents the information being stored in the linked list. Next : It is a reference to the next node in the sequence. This reference connects one node to the next, forming the link between nodes. Advantages of Linked Lists Linked lists offer several advantages and use cases: Dynamic Size : Linked lists can easily grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed, as they do not require contiguous memory allocation. Insertion and Deletion : Inserting or deleting elements at the beginning or end of a linked list is efficient, as it involves updating the references in the affected nodes. Flexible Memory Allocation : Linked lists can be used when the memory allocation is not known in advance or needs to be managed dynamically. Implementation of Other Data Structures : Linked lists serve as a foundation for implementing other complex data structures, such as stacks, queues, and graphs. Drawbacks of Linked Lists Sequential Access : Unlike arrays, linked lists do not offer direct random access to elements. Accessing a specific element requires traversing the list from the beginning until the desired node is reached. Additional Memory Overhead : Linked lists require additional memory to store the references between nodes, which can result in higher memory usage compared to arrays for the same number of elements. Reverse Traversal : While singly linked lists (with references to the next node only) can be traversed in one direction, reverse traversal or accessing the previous node requires a doubly linked list (with references to both the next and previous nodes).

In this lesson, we'll implement one in TypeScript. Node Class & Constructor Before we create the linked list class, we need to create a node class. The node class will be used to create the nodes that make up the linked list. Each node will have a data property and a next property. The data property will store the data that the node holds. The next property will point to the next node in the linked list. class Node<T> { data: T; next: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; constructor(data: T) { this.data = data; } } LinkedList Class & Constructor Now that we have a node class, we can create the linked list class. The linked list class will have a head property and a tail property. The head property will point to the first node in the linked list. The tail property will point to the last node in the linked list. When we start out, the head and tail properties will both be undefined . export class LinkedList<T> { head: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; tail: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; } add Method The add method will add a new node to the end of the linked list. It takes in a data value which will get passed into the node constructor. It then checks to see if the head property is undefined . If it is, it sets the head property to the new node. If it isn't, it sets the next property of the tail node to the new node. It then sets the tail property to the new node. The time complexity of this method is O(1) because it doesn't have to loop through the linked list to add the new node. It just has to set the next property of the tail node to the new node and then set the tail property to the new node. add(data: T): void { const node = new Node<T>(data); if (this.head === undefined) { this.head = node; } else if (this.tail) { this.tail.next = node; } this.tail = node; } printAll Method We want to be able to test this out, so let's add a method that will print out all of the nodes in the linked list. The printAll method will start at the head node and loop through each node until it reaches the tail node. It will print out the data of each node as it loops through. printAll(): void { let current = this.head; while (current !== undefined) { console.log(current.data); current = current.next; } } We can now test this by creating a new linked list and adding some nodes to it. const list = new LinkedList(); list.add(1); list.add(2); list.add(3); list.add(4); list.printAll(); get Method The get method will return the data of the node at the specified index.

It takes in an index value and a data value. It then checks to see if the index is 0. If it is, it creates a new node and sets the next property of the new node to the head node. It then sets the head property to the new node. If the index is not 0, it loops through the linked list until it reaches the node at the specified index.

In general, pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. This concept is more abstract in TypeScript and not as prevalent as in languages like C and C++, where special types and characters are used to declare and work with pointers, such as the * character for declaring a pointer variable and the & character to get the address of a variable. In TypeScript, pointers are not explicitly used, but the underlying mechanism is still present when dealing with objects and arrays. It is different with primitive values, so we will look at examples of both. Let's start with primitives, which are strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined and symbols. Let's examine a simple example: let a = 1; let b = a; console.log(b); // 1 In this example, we have two variables, a is set to 1 and b is set to a . If we log b it is 1 . If we change the value of a , b is not affected. This is because primitive values in TypeScript are assigned by value, not by reference. When you assign a to b , the actual value of a (which is 1) is copied into b . As a result, b becomes an independent copy of the value stored in a , and any subsequent changes made to a will not impact the value stored in b . This behavior is consistent with primitive data types like numbers, strings, and booleans, where each variable holds its own distinct value in memory. let a = 1; let b = a; a = 2; console.log(b); // 1 Objects and arrays, on the other hand, behave differently. When you assign an object or an array to another variable, you are actually copying the reference to the object or array, not the actual value. This means that both variables will point to the same memory location where the object or array is stored. Consequently, if you modify the contents of the object or array using one variable, the changes will be reflected when accessing the object or array through the other variable. Let's look at an example: const c = { name: \"John\" }; const d = c; console.log(d.name); // John d now points to the same area in memory as c . If we log d.name , we get John. If we change the value of c.name to Brad and then log d.name , you will see that d.name is now Brad as well. This is because we copied the reference, not the actual value. const c = { name: \"John\" }; const d = c; c.name = \"Brad\"; console.log(d.name); // Brad Fast and Slow Pointer Pattern There are different patterns when it comes to pointers. One of the most common patterns is the fast and slow pointer pattern. This pattern is used to solve problems where you need to find a certain node or element in a linked list or array. Remember, nodes are objects, so they are passed by reference. The idea of this pattern is that the pointers start at the same point, but one pointer moves faster than the other. The faster pointer moves at twice the speed of the slower pointer. When the faster pointer reaches the end of the list, the slower pointer will be at the middle node. let's look at a quick example: function findMiddle(head: LinkedList): Node | undefined { let slow = head; // slow pointer let fast = head; // fast pointer while (fast !== undefined && fast.next !== undefined) { fast = fast.next.next; // moves two nodes at a time slow = slow.next; // moves one node at a time } return slow; // returns the middle node } This findMiddle function takes in the head of a linked list and returns the middle node. The function uses two pointers, slow and fast , to traverse the linked list. The slow pointer moves one node at a time because of the slow.next assignment, while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time because of the fast.next.next assignment. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle node. In the next lesson, we are going to implement a find middle function using the LinkedList class that we created.","title":"Working With Pointers"},{"location":"practice-exercises/07-12/#working-with-pointers","text":"Before we move on to the next challenge, let's talk more about pointers and how they work. In general, pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. This concept is more abstract in TypeScript and not as prevalent as in languages like C and C++, where special types and characters are used to declare and work with pointers, such as the * character for declaring a pointer variable and the & character to get the address of a variable. In TypeScript, pointers are not explicitly used, but the underlying mechanism is still present when dealing with objects and arrays. It is different with primitive values, so we will look at examples of both. Let's start with primitives, which are strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined and symbols. Let's examine a simple example: let a = 1; let b = a; console.log(b); // 1 In this example, we have two variables, a is set to 1 and b is set to a . If we log b it is 1 .

In this exercise you will use two pointers to traverse an iterable data structure at different speeds. We want to do this to find the middle node of a linked list. Instructions Write a function called findMiddle that takes in a linked list. The function should return the middle node of the linked list. If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node in the list. Function Signature /** * Returns the middle node of the linked list. * @param list The linked list. * @returns The middle node of the linked list. */ function findMiddle(list: LinkedList): Node | undefined; Examples const list = new LinkedList(); list.add(1); list.add(2); list.add(3); // Middle node list.add(4); list.add(5); findMiddle(list); // returns node with value 3 const list = new LinkedList(); list.add(1); list.add(2); list.add(3); list.add(4); // Second middle node list.add(5); list.add(6); findMiddle(list); // returns node with value 4 Hints Use two pointers to solve this problem One pointer should move at twice the speed of the other pointer When the faster pointer reaches the end of the list, the slower pointer will be at the middle node Solutions Click For Solution export function findMiddle<T>(list: LinkedList<T>): Node<T> | undefined { let slow = list.head; let fast = list.head; let prev; while (fast !== undefined && fast.next !== undefined) { fast = fast.next.next; prev = slow; slow = slow?.next; } if (fast === undefined) { return prev?.next; } else { return slow; } } Explanation We will use the fast and slow pointer pattern to find the middle node of the linked list. Set both pointers to the head of the list. Run a while loop to traverse the list. The loop condition is that the fast pointer is not undefined and the next node of the fast pointer is not undefined . This ensures that the fast pointer is always ahead of the slow pointer. Inside the loop, move the fast pointer two nodes at a time by assigning fast = fast.next.next . Then move the slow pointer one node at a time by assigning slow = slow.next . After the loop, check if the fast pointer is undefined . If it is undefined , then the list has an even number of nodes. In this case, return the second middle node, which is the next node of the slow pointer. If the fast pointer is not undefined , then the list has an odd number of nodes. In this case, return the slow pointer. Time & Space Complexity The time complexity of the function findMiddle(list) is O(n) , where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because the function examines each node once. The space complexity of the function is O(1) . Regardless of the size of the linked list, the function only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the slow , fast , and prev pointers.

Where each node points to the next. There are other types of linked lists as well such as the doubly linked list . This lesson will introduce you to the concept of a doubly linked list. Like a linked list, a doubly linked list is a linear data structure made up of a sequence of nodes, but in a doubly linked list, each node contains two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node in the sequence. This bidirectional linking allows for more flexibility in traversal and manipulation of the list. Structure of a Doubly Linked List Each node in a doubly linked list contains three parts: Previous : A pointer to the previous node in the sequence, enabling traversal in reverse order. Data : It holds the value or payload representing the information stored in the node. Next : A pointer to the next node in the sequence, facilitating forward traversal. The first node in the list is the head , and the last node is the tail . Both the head and tail pointers can be used to efficiently access the beginning and end of the list. This image depicts a doubly linked list with four nodes. Each node has pointers to the previous and next nodes. The head node's prev pointer is undefined because there is no previous node. Similarly, the tail node's next pointer is undefined . Advantages of Doubly Linked Lists Doubly linked lists offer several advantages, building upon the features of a singly linked list: Bidirectional Traversal : Doubly linked lists allow traversing in both forward and reverse directions efficiently, as each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes. Efficient Insertion and Deletion : Insertion or deletion of nodes at the beginning, end, or middle of the list can be more efficient than with singly linked lists, as both the previous and next pointers need to be updated. Reverse Traversal : Accessing nodes in reverse order becomes possible without the need to reconstruct the list. Drawbacks of Doubly Linked Lists Memory Overhead : Each node in a doubly linked list requires extra memory to store two pointers instead of one. This can lead to increased memory consumption compared to both arrays and singly linked lists. Code Complexity : The bidirectional pointers increase the complexity of implementation and maintenance compared to singly linked lists.

If you want to try this on your own, going on the knowledge that you have of a linked list and what was explained about a doubly linked list, go ahead and try to implement this on your own. If you get stuck, you can always come back to this lesson. Node Class We will first create a Node class that will be used to create nodes for our doubly linked list. The Node class will take in a value and set the value property to the value that is passed in. It will also set the next and prev properties to undefined . class Node<T> { data: T; next: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; prev: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; constructor(data: T) { this.data = data; } } DoublyLinkedList Class Next, we will create a DoublyLinkedList class that will be used to create doubly linked lists. The DoublyLinkedList class will set the head and tail properties to undefined and the length property to 0 . export class DoublyLinkedList<T> { head: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; tail: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; length = 0; } append Method We will add a method called append to the DoublyLinkedList class. This method will add a node to the end of the doubly linked list. append(data: T): void { const newNode = new Node(data); if (!this.head) { this.head = newNode; this.tail = newNode; } else { newNode.prev = this.tail; this.tail && (this.tail.next = newNode); this.tail = newNode; } this.length++; } We create a new node with the data that is passed in. If the head property is undefined , then we set the head and tail properties to the new node. Otherwise, we set the prev property of the new node to the current tail node. We then set the next property of the current tail node to the new node. Finally, we set the tail property to the new node. Let's try out what we have so far. const list = new DoublyLinkedList(); list.append(1); list.append(2); list.append(3); console.log(list); You should see something like this: DoublyLinkedList { head: <ref *1> Node { data: 1, next: Node { data: 2, next: [Node], prev: [Circular *1] }, prev: null }, tail: <ref *2> Node { data: 3, next: null, prev: Node { data: 2, next: [Circular *2], prev: [Node] } }, length: 3 } This shows us that we have a doubly linked list with a head and tail node. The head node has a next node and the tail node has a prev node. The prev of the first node and the next of the last node are both undefined . printAll Method Let's create a method to print out all of the data in the list. We will add a method called printAll to the DoublyLinkedList class. printAll(): void { let current = this.head; while (current) { console.log(current.data); current = current.next; } } You can test this with the following: const list = new DoublyLinkedList(); list.append(1); list.append(2); list.append(3); list.printAll(); You should see something like this: 1 2 3 prepend Method Let's add a method to add a node to the beginning of the list. We will call this method prepend . It will take in a value and add a node to the beginning of the list. prepend(data: T): void { const newNode = new Node(data); if (!this.head) { this.head = newNode; this.tail = newNode; } else { newNode.next = this.head; this.head.prev = newNode; this.head = newNode; } this.length++; } We create a new node with the data that is passed in. If the head property is undefined , then we set the head and tail properties to the new node. Otherwise, we set the next property of the new node to the current head node. We then set the prev property of the current head node to the new node. Finally, we set the head property to the new node. You can try with: const list = new DoublyLinkedList(); list.append(1); list.append(2); list.append(3); list.prepend('Hello'); list.printAll(); You should see something like this: Hello 1 2 3 insertAt Method Let's add a method to insert a node at a specific index. We will call this method insertAt . It will take in an index and a value and insert a node at that index. insertAt(index: number, data: T): void { if (index < 0 || index > this.length) { return; } if (index === 0) { this.prepend(data); return; } if (index === this.length) { this.append(data); return; } const newNode = new Node(data); let currentNode = this.head; for (let i = 0; i < index - 1; i++) { currentNode = currentNode?.next; } newNode.next = currentNode?.next; newNode.prev = currentNode; currentNode?.next && (currentNode.next.prev = newNode); currentNode && (currentNode.next = newNode); this.length++; } We first check if the index is valid. If it is, we check if the index is 0 . If it is, we call the prepend method. We then check if the index is the same as the length of the list. If it is, we call the append method. Otherwise, we create a new node with the data that is passed in. We then loop through the list until we get to the node before the index. We set the next property of the new node to the next property of the current node. We set the prev property of the new node to the current node. We set the prev property of the node after the new node to the new node. We set the next property of the current node to the new node.

We will call this method get . It will take in an index and return the node at that index. get(index: number): Node<T> | undefined { if (index < 0 || index >= this.length) { return undefined; } let currentNode = this.head; for (let i = 0; i < index; i++) { currentNode = currentNode?.next; } return currentNode; } We first check if the index is valid. If it is, we loop through the list until we get to the node at the index and return it. You can try with: console.log(list.get(0)); You should see something like this: <ref *2> Node { data: 'Hello', next: <ref *1> Node { data: 1, next: Node { data: 'World', next: [Node], prev: [Circular *1] }, prev: [Circular *2] }, prev: undefined } remove Method Let's add a method to remove a node at a specific index. We will call this method remove . It will take in an index and remove the node at that index. remove(index: number): void { if (index < 0 || index >= this.length) { return; } if (index === 0) { this.head = this.head?.next; if (this.head) { this.head.prev = undefined; } else { this.tail = undefined; } } else if (index === this.length - 1) { this.tail = this.tail?.prev; if (this.tail) { this.tail.next = undefined; } else { this.head = undefined; } } else { let currentNode = this.head; for (let i = 0; i < index; i++) { currentNode = currentNode?.next; } currentNode?.prev && (currentNode.prev.next = currentNode?.next); currentNode?.next && (currentNode.next.prev = currentNode?.prev); } this.length--; } We first check if the list is empty by checking if the head is undefined . If it is, we return. If it is not empty, we continue and set the currentNode to the head . We then loop through the list until we find the node with the data that we want to remove. If we find it, we check if it is the head node. If it is, we set the head to the next node. We also check if the head is not undefined . If it is not, we set the prev of the head to undefined because it is now the first node. If the node is not the head , we check if it is the tail node. If it is, we set the tail to the prev node. We also set the next of the tail to undefined because it is now the last node. If the node is neither the head nor the tail , we set the next of the prev node to the next node. We also set the prev of the next node to the prev node. We then decrement the length and return true . If we do not find the node, we return false . You can test this out with the following code: const list = new DoublyLinkedList(); list.append(1); list.append(2); list.append(3); list.prepend('Hello'); list.insert(2, 'World'); list.remove(4); list.printAll(); You should now see something like this: Hello 1 World 2 3","title":"Doubly Linked List Implementation"},{"location":"practice-exercises/07-15/#doubly-linked-list-implementation","text":"In this lesson, we will create a doubly linked list class in TypeScript.

Trees are widely used in various applications. Things like file systems (where nodes represent folders and files) and organization charts, implementing search algorithms (e.g., binary search tree), and providing efficient data access and manipulation such as in a heap. If you're a web developer, then you're familiar with the DOM (Document Object Model). That is actually an example of a tree structure. Here is a visual representation of a tree: The circles represent what are called nodes . These nodes contain data or information. In this example, each node just contains a number, but in a real-world application, it could be anything. The nodes have relationships to each other. These relationships are represented by the lines connecting the nodes. These lines are called edges . Look at the node with the number 2 in it. It is a child of node 1 and a parent of node 4 and 5. Nodes 4 and 5 are siblings of each other because they share the same parent. Let's look more into the terminology of trees. Nodes : Each node in a tree contains data or information and can have zero or more child nodes. Nodes are connected by edges, representing the relationships between them. Root : The root of a tree is the topmost node and serves as the starting point for traversing the tree. It does not have any parent nodes but may have child nodes. Parent, Child & Sibling Nodes : A parent node is a node that has child nodes directly connected to it. Child nodes are nodes directly connected to a parent node. Each child node has only one parent node. Nodes that share the same parent node are called sibling nodes. Leaf Nodes : Leaf nodes, also known as terminal nodes, are nodes that have no child nodes. They represent the endpoints of the tree branches. Path : A path in a tree refers to the sequence of nodes and edges from one node to another. It represents the route or traversal from the starting node to the destination node. In the image below, the path 1-2-5 represents the route or the path from node 1 to node 5. Depth & Height The terms depth and height are used to define the structure of a tree. They help us understand how deep or how tall the tree is and provide insight into its characteristics. Depth Of A Node The depth of a node refers to the number of edges along the path from the root node to the particular node . If we look at the tree above, the depth of node 1 is 0 as it's the root. The depth of node 2 is 1 and the depth of node 4, 5, 6 and 7 is 2. Height Of A Node The height of a node refers to the number of edges along the longest path from that node to a leaf node . It measures how far a node is from the deepest leaf node in a tree. In the tree above, the height of node 1 is 4 since the longest path to the furthest leaf is 4. Node 2 has a height of 2 and node 3 has a height of 3. Height Of A Tree The height of a tree is the same as the height of its root node. This tree has a height of 4 since the longest path from the root is 4. Bianary Tree A binary tree is a special type of tree that has one root node and each node can have at most two child nodes, often referred to as the left child and the right child or just left and right. The tree that we are looking at is considered a binary tree because it has one root node and each node has at most two child nodes. Node 4 would be the left child of node 2, and node 5 would be the right child of node 2. There is also a clear path between the root and any one node. Sometimes you'll see trees that are split up and there are 3 nodes off by themselves. Or you may see a tree where the nodes are just connected in a circle and there is no clear root. Those are not binary trees. There are different types of binary trees and there is also something called a binary search tree , which we'll look into in a bit.

This one is called Depth First Traversal . This is a traversal algorithm where the algorithm starts at a root node, which we know is the one at the top of the tree with no parent, and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. So if we look at the following tree: We would start at a and then go to b . From here, we would go to d because we are going as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. d is as far as we can go on this path because it is a leaf node , which means it has no children. So now we can move over to e . If e had a child, we would move down, but since it doesn't, we're going to move over to c . From c , we can move down in depth to f . So this pattern would be a , b , d , e , c , f . Now we want to implement this algorithm. We are going to use a stack to implement this algorithm because we want to keep track of the nodes we have visited. Remember a stack is a LIFO data structure, which means Last In First Out . So the last node we visit will be the first node we pop off the stack. When a node is popped off or removed from the stack, we can say that node has been visited . When a node is popped off the stack, it will be put in a variable called current . We will then check if current has a right child. If it does, we will add it to the stack.

We first check if the root node exists. If it doesn't, we return an empty array. We then create a result array and a stack array. We then push the root node onto the stack. We then start a while loop that will run as long as the stack array has a length greater than 0 . Inside the while loop, we pop the last node off the stack and add it to the result array. We then check if the current node has a right child. If it does, we add it to the stack. We then check if the current node has a left child. If it does, we add it to the stack.

Unlike depth-first traversal, which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, breadth-first traversal explores all the nodes at the current depth level before moving to the next level. To illustrate this algorithm, let's consider the same binary tree we used in the depth-first traversal example: For breadth-first traversal, we start at the root node a and visit its children, b and c , in order. Then, we move down to the next level and visit the children of b and c , which are d , e , and f . We continue this pattern, visiting all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level. So the order of traversal in this example would be a , b , c , d , e , f . To implement the breadth-first traversal algorithm, we'll use a queue data structure. A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure, which means the first node we add to the queue will be the first node we remove from the queue. We'll start by pushing the root node onto the queue and then iterate through the queue, adding the children of each node to the queue as we visit them. Let's implement the breadth-first traversal in TypeScript: export class Node<T> { data: T; left: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; right: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; constructor(data: T) { this.data = data; } } export function breadthFirstTraversal<T>(root: Node<T> | undefined): T[] { if (!root) { return []; } const result: T[] = []; const queue: Node<T>[] = []; queue.push(root); while (queue.length > 0) { const current = queue.shift(); current && result.push(current.data); if (current?.left) { queue.push(current.left); } if (current?.right) { queue.push(current.right); } } return result; } In this implementation, we first check if the root node exists. If it doesn't, we return an empty array. We then create a result array and a queue array. We push the root node onto the queue. We then start a while loop that runs as long as the queue array has a length greater than 0 . Inside the loop, we dequeue the first node from the queue (using shift() ) and add it to the result array. We then enqueue the left and right children of the current node, if they exist. We continue this process until the queue array is empty, and then we return the result array. Using the Queue Class Now, let's refactor this code to use the Queue class. You can do this as an exercise, or you can look at the code below. export class Node<T> { data: T; left: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; right: Node<T> | undefined = undefined; constructor(data: T) { this.data = data; } } export function breadthFirstTraversal<T>(root: Node<T> | undefined): T[] { if (!root) { return []; } const result = []; const queue = new Queue(); queue.enqueue(root); while (!queue.isEmpty()) { const current = queue.dequeue(); result.push(current.data); if (current.left) { queue.enqueue(current.left); } if (current.right) { queue.enqueue(current.right); } } return result; } In this refactored code, we used the Queue class instead of a standard array for the queue data structure.

A binary search tree (BST) is a specific type of binary tree that follows a particular ordering and sorting property. While the ordering rule is commonly associated with numeric values, it's important to note that binary search trees can handle various types of data, not just numbers. One of the key advantages of binary search trees are that they're versatile enough to accommodate any data type that can be compared for ordering. For instance, consider a binary search tree that stores strings representing names in alphabetical order. The tree's structure ensures that names are organized in a way that allows for efficient searches, insertions, and deletions. Similarly, binary search trees can be used for custom objects, where the ordering is determined by specific attributes or properties of the objects such as the price of a product. So we'll be using numeric values just for simplicity and so you can wrap your head around it. Let's look at the following tree and go over the rules for a BST: Each node has at most two child nodes, referred to as the left child and the right child. The left child's value is less than the parent node's value. The right child's value is greater than or equal to the parent node's value. The image above is a valid BST. Everything on the left is less than it's parent and everything on the right is greater than the parent. This does not only apply to immediate child nodes. Let's look at the image on the following image: If we look at the tree on the right-hand side, it is a valid binary tree, but it is not a valid binary search tree. The reason being that 3 is on the right side of 4, but 3 is less than 4. Everything on the right side of a node must be greater than or equal to the node's value. This ordering makes searching very efficient. Let's say we are searching for the value 7. We start at the root node of 9. 7 is less than 9, so we move to the left child node of 4. 7 is greater than 4, so we move to the right child node of 4 and we find 7. The time complexity of search, insertion, and deletion operations in a binary search tree is O(log n) , where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because the search space is reduced by half at each step. This type of searching is much more efficient than a linear search, which instead goes through each element one by one and has a time complexity of O(n) . Operations on a Binary Search Tree These are the three main operations on a binary search tree. Here is a quick summary on the process for all three. It most likely won't be completely clear until we actually code it out. Insertion : To insert a new node into a binary search tree, we start at the root and compare the new node's value with the current node's value. If the value is less, we move to the left subtree; if it is greater or equal, we move to the right subtree. This process continues recursively until we find an empty spot, where we insert the new node. Search : Searching for a value in a binary search tree follows a similar process as insertion. Starting at the root, we compare the value with the current node's value. If it matches, the search is successful. If it is less, we move to the left subtree; if it is greater, we move to the right subtree. This process continues recursively until we find the value or reach an undefined reference, indicating that the value is not in the tree. Deletion : Deleting a node in a binary search tree involves several cases, depending on the node's children. If the node to be deleted has no children (a leaf node), it can be simply removed. If it has one child, that child replaces the deleted node. If it has two children, it can be replaced by either the largest node in its left subtree (called its predecessor) or the smallest node in its right subtree (called its successor). This process maintains the binary search tree property. Binary search trees are used in various applications where efficient search and retrieval of data are essential. However, it's crucial to ensure that the tree remains balanced to avoid degradation of its performance. There are different balancing techniques like AVL trees and Red-Black trees to achieve this. There are online tools that you can use to create a binary search tree and visualize the operations on it such as https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html and http://btv.melezinek.cz/binary-search-tree.html.

In the next lesson, let's implement a binary search tree in TypeScript.","title":"Operations on a Binary Search Tree"},{"location":"practice-exercises/08-08/","text":"Binary Search Tree Implementation In this lesson, we will implement a binary search tree in TypeScript. We will start by creating a Node class, which will represent each node in the tree. Each node will have a value , a left property, and a right property. The left and right properties will point to other nodes, or be undefined if there is no left or right child. export class Node { value: number; left: Node | undefined = undefined; right: Node | undefined = undefined; constructor(value: number) { this.value = value; } } Next, we will create a BinarySearchTree class. This class will have a root property, which will point to the root node of the tree. Initially, the root node will be undefined . export class BinarySearchTree { root: Node | undefined = undefined; } insert Method Next, we will implement the insert method. This method will take a value as an argument, and insert a new node with that value into the tree. insert(value: number): void { const newNode = new Node(value); if (this.root === undefined) { this.root = newNode; } else { let currentNode = this.root; while (true) { if (value < currentNode.value) { if (!currentNode.left) { currentNode.left = newNode; return; } currentNode = currentNode.left; } else { if (!currentNode.right) { currentNode.right = newNode; return; } currentNode = currentNode.right; } } } } We start by creating a new node with the given value. If the tree is empty, we set the root node to be the new node. Otherwise, we start at the root node, and traverse the tree until we find a node without a left or right child. If the new value is less than the current node's value, we move on to the left child. If the new value is greater than or equal to the current node's value, we move on to the right child. We continue this process until we find a node without a left or right child, and then we insert the new node at that location. lookup Method Next, we will implement the lookup method. This method will take a value as an argument, and return the node with that value if it exists in the tree. If the value does not exist in the tree, we will return undefined . lookup(value: number): Node | undefined { let currentNode = this.root; if (!currentNode) { return undefined; } while (currentNode) { if (value < currentNode.value) { currentNode = currentNode.left; } else if (value > currentNode.value) { currentNode = currentNode.right; } else if (value === currentNode.value) { return currentNode; } } return undefined; } We set the current node to be the root node. If the tree is empty, we return undefined . Otherwise, we traverse the tree until we find a node with the given value. If the value is less than the current node's value, we move on to the left child. If the value is greater than the current node's value, we move on to the right child. If the value is equal to the current node's value, we return the current node. If we reach a node that does not have a left or right child, we return undefined . remove Method Next, we will implement the remove method. This method will take a value as an argument, and remove the node with that value from the tree. remove(value: number): void { function removeNode( node: Node | undefined, value: number ): Node | undefined { if (node === undefined) { return undefined; } if (value < node.value) { node.left = removeNode(node.left, value); return node; } else if (value > node.value) { node.right = removeNode(node.right, value); return node; } else { if (node.left === undefined) { return node.right; } else if (node.right === undefined) { return node.left; } let tempNode = node.right; while (tempNode.left !== undefined) { tempNode = tempNode.left; } node.value = tempNode.value; node.right = removeNode(node.right, tempNode.value); return node; } } this.root = removeNode(this.root, value); } This one is pretty tough. We start by creating a helper function called removeNode . This function will take a node and a value as arguments, and return the node with the given value removed from the tree. If the node is undefined , we return undefined . Otherwise, we traverse the tree until we find the node with the given value. If the value is less than the current node's value, we move on to the left child. If the value is greater than the current node's value, we move on to the right child. If the value is equal to the current node's value, we have found the node we want to remove. There are three cases we need to consider: The node has no children or only one child The node has two children The node is the root node Case 1: Node with no child or only one child If the node has no children or only one child, we can simply return the node's left or right child. This will remove the node from the tree. Case 2: Node with two children If the node has two children, we need to find the smallest value in the right subtree. This value will be the node's successor. We will replace the node's value with the successor's value, and then remove the successor from the tree. Case 3: Node is the root node If the node is the root node, we need to replace the root node with the successor. We will replace the root node's value with the successor's value, and then remove the successor from the tree. printTree Method Finally, we will implement the printTree method. This method will print the tree in a human-readable format. printTree(): void { function printNode(node: Node | undefined): void { if (node === undefined) { return; } node.left && printNode(node.left); console.log(node.value); node.right && printNode(node.right); } printNode(this.root); } Binary Search Tree Runtime Analysis BST's are very efficient data structures. They are very fast at inserting, looking up, and deleting values and have a runtime of O(log n) for each of these operations except for printing the tree, which has a runtime of O(n). This is because we have to visit every node in the tree to print it. Operation Runtime Insert O(log n) Lookup O(log n) Delete O(log n) Print O(n) Binary Search Tree Example const bst = new BinarySearchTree(); bst.insert(9); bst.insert(4); bst.insert(11); bst.insert(2); bst.insert(7); bst.insert(15); bst.insert(5); bst.insert(8); This will create the tree. We can use the lookup method to find a node in the tree. Let's find the node with the value 4 and log it. console.log(bst.lookup(4)); This will log the following: { value: 4, left: { value: 2, left: undefined, right: undefined }, right: { value: 7, left: [Node], right: [Node] } } You can see that the node with the value 4 has a left child with the value 2, and a right child with the value 7. Let's remove the node with the value 7 from the tree. bst.remove(7); Now lookup 4 again: console.log(bst.lookup(4)); This will log the following: { value: 4, left: { value: 2, left: undefined, right: undefined }, right: { value: 8, left: [Node], right: undefined } } You can see that the node with the value 4 now has a right child with the value 8 instead of 7.

Graphs are used to represent many real-world applications: social networks, maps, routing algorithms, and more. You may hear the phrase \"graph theory\" in computer science. Graph theory is the study of graphs and their properties. It's a vast field of study with many applications in computer science and other fields. Visual Representation of a Graph Here is a visual representation of a few graphs: The circles represent nodes , also called vertex or vertices (plural) and the lines connecting the nodes represent edges . If you think of a social network, you can think of the users as nodes and the connections or friendships between users as edges. Types of Graphs Graphs can be categorized into several types based on their properties: Undirected Graph : In an undirected graph, the edges have no direction. If there is an edge between node A and node B, it implies a connection between both nodes in both directions. The top one is an undirected graph. Directed Graph (Digraph) : In a directed graph, each edge has a specific direction. An edge from node A to node B indicates a one-way connection from A to B. The bottom one is a directed graph. Weighted Graph : In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. These weights represent the strength of the relationship or the distance between nodes. Cyclic Graph : A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle, which means there is a closed path in the graph. (See below for an example.) Acyclic Graph : An acyclic graph is a graph that does not contain any cycles. Connected Graph : A connected graph is one where there is a path between any two nodes. In other words, every node in the graph can be reached from any other node. Disconnected Graph : A disconnected graph is one that consists of two or more separate subgraphs, and there is no path between nodes in different subgraphs. Graph cycles A cycle is a closed path in a graph. In other words, a cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node. Here is an example of a cycle in a graph: A cycle starts and ends at the same node. In this example, the cycle is b -> c -> e -> d -> b .

In this lesson, we'll look at both of these approaches. Adjacency Matrix An adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array that stores the edges between two vertices as boolean values. The rows and columns of the matrix represent the vertices of the graph. Let's look at an example: At the top we have a graph with some vertices and edges. At the bottom we have the adjacency matrix representation of the graph. The rows and columns represent the vertices of the graph. If we look at the vertex with the value of 1, we can see that it has edges to vertices 2 and 4. So we put a 1 in the first row for 2 and 4. This is an undirected graph, so it goes the other way as well. So we can put a 1 in the 2 row and the 4 row for 1. If this were a directed graph, we would only put a 1 in the 1 row for 2 and 4. The formula to see if a vertex i is connected to vertex j is matrix[i][j] . i is the row and j is the column. So matrix[1][2] is 1, which means that vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2. matrix[2][1] is also 1, which means that vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1. To represent this adjacency matrix with a two dimensional array in TypeScript, we can do this: [ [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], ]; Adjacency List An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or arrays that lists all of the other vertices that are connected. Let's look at an example that uses linked lists. Every vertex has a linked list of all the vertices that it is connected to: If you wanted to represent this list with a TypeScript object, you could do this: { 1: [2, 4], 2: [1, 3, 4], 3: [2, 4, 5], 4: [1, 2, 3, 5], 5: [3, 4] }; Which one is better? The answer is: it depends. It depends on the type of graph and the type of operations you want to perform on the graph. If you have a graph with a lot of edges, then the adjacency matrix might be better. If you have a graph with a lot of vertices, then the adjacency list might be better. If you want to be able to quickly tell if there is an edge between two vertices, then the adjacency matrix might be better. If you want to be able to quickly iterate over all the edges of a vertex, then the adjacency list might be better. Overall, the adjacency list is easier and more commonly used.

The two most common ways are depth-first traversal and breadth-first traversal . We have already looked at these using trees, but the same concepts apply to graphs. Depth-First Traversal In depth-first traversal, we start at a vertex/node. In a tree, you would start at the root node. In a graph, you can start at any vertex. We then explore as far along each branch as possible before backtracking. We continue this process until we have visited all of the vertices in the graph. One common way to implement depth-first traversal is to use a stack . We start by pushing the starting vertex onto the stack. We then pop the vertex off the stack and visit it. We then push all of its neighbors onto the stack. We continue this process until the stack is empty. So take this graph for example: We have 5 vertices labeled a through e with 6 edges connecting them. We are going to traverse this graph using depth-first traversal. We could start at any vertex, but let's start at a and walk through the process. We start at vertex a and put it on the stack and mark it as visited From here, we can go to vertex b or c . Let's go to b . We put b on the stack and mark it as visited From b , we can go to e . We put e on the stack and mark it as visited From e , let's go to c . We put c on the stack and mark it as visited At this point, in both our stack and in the visited table, we have a , b , e , and c . c does not have any neighbors that we haven't already visited, so we pop it off the stack We look at the top of the stack and see that e is next. Does e have any neighbors that we haven't already visited? Yes, d . We put d on the stack and mark it as visited d is now at the top of the stack and does not have any neighbors that we haven't already visited, so we pop it off the stack Now e is on top of the stack. It has no neighbors that we have not visited, so we pop it off the stack Now b is on top of the stack. It has no neighbors that we have not visited, so we pop it off the stack Now a is on top of the stack. It has no neighbors that we have not visited, so we pop it off the stack The stack is now empty, so we are done Breadth-First Traversal Now let's explore another graph traversal technique called breadth-first traversal. In contrast to depth-first traversal, which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, breadth-first traversal visits all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the next level. In order to implement breadth-first traversal, we utilize a queue data structure. Starting from a given vertex, we enqueue it into the queue and mark it as visited. Then, while the queue is not empty, we perform the following steps: Dequeue a vertex from the front of the queue. Visit the dequeued vertex. Enqueue all its unvisited neighbors into the queue and mark them as visited. By following these steps, we will traverse the graph level by level until all vertices have been visited. Let's apply breadth-first traversal to the same graph we used for depth-first traversal: We start at vertex a and enqueue it into the queue Then we dequeue a from the front of the queue and mark it as visited. Now we enqueue all of a 's unvisited neighbors into the queue. a has three neighbors: b , c , and d . We enqueue them in that order. The queue now looks like this: b , c , d . With the b to the right because that is the start. Now we dequeue b from the front of the queue. We visit b and enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors into the queue. b has one unvisited neighbor: e . We enqueue e into the queue. The queue now looks like this: c , d , e . We dequeue c from the front of the queue. We visit c and enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors into the queue. c has no unvisited neighbors, so we do not enqueue anything. The queue now looks like this: d , e . We dequeue d from the front of the queue. We visit d and enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors into the queue. d has no unvisited neighbors, so we do not enqueue anything. The queue now looks like this: e . We dequeue e from the front of the queue. We visit e and enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors into the queue. e has no unvisited neighbors, so we do not enqueue anything.

In this section, we're going to get into sorting algorithms . This can get advanced so we'll start with the basics. We looked at Binary search trees in the last section. So you know that in order to use a Binary search tree , you need to insert the data in a sorted order. But how do you sort the data? Well, you use a sorting algorithm . A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical/alphabetical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms such as searching and merging , which require input data to be in sorted lists. Efficiency of Sorting Algorithms There are many different sorting algorithms and each has its own advantages and limitations. Sorting is a basic building block that many other algorithms are built on. Therefore, it is important to know how sorting algorithms work and their relative efficiency. Efficiency in an algorithm is defined in terms of the time complexity and space complexity , which we've already talked about. As a reminder, time complexity is a measure of the amount of time it takes for the algorithm to run. Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory space it takes for the algorithm to run. Sorting algorithm performance can be classified by: Best case complexity: the minimum possible number of operations required to sort the data. Average case complexity: the average number of operations required to sort the data. Worst case complexity: the maximum number of operations required to sort the data. Memory usage : the amount of memory space required to sort the data. These are expressed using Big O notation , which we've also talked about.

Strategies for sorting: Recursion \u2014 Recursion can be used in sorting algorithms. We know that recursion is when a function calls itself with a smaller version of the input. We'll see how this can be used in sorting algorithms. Divide and conquer \u2014 A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. This is very similar to recursion. We'll see how this can be used in sorting algorithms. In-place sorting \u2014 An in-place sorting algorithm uses constant extra space for producing the output (modifies the given array only to produce the sorted array). It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list. We'll see how this can be used in sorting algorithms.

Strategies for sorting: Recursion \u2014 Recursion can be used in sorting algorithms. We know that recursion is when a function calls itself with a smaller version of the input. We'll see how this can be used in sorting algorithms. Divide and conquer \u2014 A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. This is very similar to recursion. We'll see how this can be used in sorting algorithms. In-place sorting \u2014 An in-place sorting algorithm uses constant extra space for producing the output (modifies the given array only to produce the sorted array). It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list. We'll see how this can be used in sorting algorithms. Let's jump right in and look at the first sorting algorithm, Bubble sort , in the next lesson.","title":"Types of Sorting Algorithms"},{"location":"practice-exercises/09-02/","text":"Bubble Sort Algorithm In this lesson, we're going to look at the Bubble sort algorithm. This is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It's also one of the least efficient. But it's a good place to start because it's easy to understand. It is also a very common interview question. What is Bubble Sort? The Bubble sort sorting algorithm is comparison-based. Each pair of adjacent elements are compared with each other and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way that smaller or larger elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list. Because it only uses comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison sort . Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to other sorting algorithms such as insertion sort . It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly in position. How Does Bubble Sort Work? Let`s look at an example. We have the following array of numbers: [5, 4, 2, 1] Here is an image that can help you visualize this process: We start by comparing the first two elements in the array. If the first element is larger than the second element, we swap them. Otherwise, we leave them as is. In this case, 5 is larger than 4, so we swap them: [4, 5, 2, 1] Next, we compare the second and third elements in the array. If the second element is larger than the third element, we swap them. Otherwise, we leave them as is. In this case, 5 is larger than 2, so we swap them: [4, 2, 5, 1] Next, we compare the third and fourth elements in the array. If the third element is larger than the fourth element, we swap them. Otherwise, we leave them as is. In this case, 5 is larger than 1, so we swap them: [4, 2, 1, 5] We have now completed one pass through the array. We repeat this process until the array is sorted. In this case, we need to repeat the process three more times: [2, 4, 1, 5] [2, 1, 4, 5] [1, 2, 4, 5] Complexity & Efficiency Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2) Best-case time complexity: O(n) Average-case time complexity: O(n^2) Space complexity: O(1) The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2) because we have to iterate through the array n times and for each iteration, we have to iterate through the array n times. This is because we have to compare each element with all the other elements in the array. What really makes bubble sorts inefficient is that it swaps elements multiple times per iteration. For example, in the first iteration, it swaps 5 and 4. Then, it swaps 5 and 2. Then, it swaps 5 and 1. It does this for each iteration. This is why the best-case time complexity is O(n). If the array is already sorted, we don't need to swap any elements.","title":"Bubble Sort Algorithm"},{"location":"practice-exercises/09-02/#bubble-sort-algorithm","text":"In this lesson, we're going to look at the Bubble sort algorithm.

Let's put your knowledge to the test and implement the Bubble Sort algorithm in TypeScript. Obviously if you have never done anything like this and all you have to go on is the last lesson, then you may have an issue doing this on your own. That's fine. You can either try and come back or just follow along. Either way, you will learn something. Instructions Implement a function called bubbleSort that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a sorted array using the Bubble Sort algorithm. Function Signature /** * Sorts an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm. * @param array The array to be sorted. * @returns The sorted array. */ function bubbleSort(array: number[]): number[]; Examples console.log(bubbleSort([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] console.log(bubbleSort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])); // Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90] Constraints The input array can contain any number of elements. The elements in the input array are unique and positive integers. Notes The Bubble Sort algorithm works by repeatedly stepping through the list of elements, comparing each pair of adjacent items, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated for each element in the list until no swaps are needed. Hints There are a ton of ways to do this, but one is to use 2 loops \u2014 one to iterate the array and one to do the swap. You can set the current element as a temp variable, assign the next element to the current and then assign the temp value to the next element Solutions Click For Solution 1 export function bubbleSort(arr: number[]): number[] { for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - i - 1; j++) { if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) { const temp = arr[j]; arr[j] = arr[j + 1]; arr[j + 1] = temp; } } } return arr; } Explanation Start a for-loop . The condition of the for-loop is i < arr.length . This will loop through the entire array. Inside the for-loop , start another for-loop . The condition of the for-loop is j < arr.length - i - 1 . This will loop through the array, but it will stop before the last element. This is because the last element will be sorted after the first pass through the array. Inside the inner for-loop , check if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, then swap the elements. We swap the elements by creating a temporary variable called temp and setting it to the current element. Then we set the current element to the next element. Finally, we set the next element to temp . Outside of the inner for-loop , return the sorted array. To have this make a bit more sense, put this console log inside the inner for-loop : console.log(arr[j], arr[j + 1]); Run this code and look at the console. const array = [5, 4, 2, 1]; const result = bubbleSort(array); console.log(result); This will display every comparison that is made. You can see that the largest element will \"bubble\" to the top of the array. It should look something like this: 5 4 5 2 5 1 4 2 4 1 2 1 Click For Solution 2 This solution is similar, but it uses a while loop instead of a for-loop . It also uses a variable called swapped to keep track of whether or not we have swapped any elements. This variable will be used to determine when we can stop looping. export function bubbleSort(arr: number[]): number[] { let swapped = false; while (!swapped) { swapped = true; for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) { const temp = arr[i]; arr[i] = arr[i + 1]; arr[i + 1] = temp; swapped = false; } } } return arr; } Explanation Declare a variable called swapped and setting it to false . This variable will keep track of whether or not we have swapped any elements. We will use this variable to determine when we can stop looping. Start a while loop. The condition of the while loop is !swapped . This means that the loop will continue to run as long as swapped is false . This is the same as saying that the loop will continue to run as long as we have swapped any elements. Inside the while loop, set swapped to true . This will ensure that the loop will run at least once. Start a for-loop . The condition of the for-loop is i < arr.length . This means that the loop will continue to run as long as i is less than the length of the array. Inside the for-loop , check if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, then swap the elements and set swapped to false . This will ensure that the loop will run again.

You start with an empty left hand and the cards face down on the table. Then you remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the correct position in the left hand. To find the correct position for a card, you compare it with each of the cards already in the hand. At all times, the cards held in the left hand are sorted. An array is split into two parts: sorted and unsorted . Initially, the sorted part just has one element (the first element). Then, we pick an element from the unsorted part and insert it into the sorted part at the correct position. We do this until the unsorted part becomes empty. Let's look at an example: [4, 3, 2, 10, 12, 1, 5, 6] The first element is already sorted. So, we pick the second element (3) and compare it with the first element (4). Since 3 is smaller than 4, we swap them. Now, the first two elements are sorted. [3, 4, 2, 10, 12, 1, 5, 6] Next, we pick the third element (2) and compare it with the first element (3). Since 2 is smaller than 3, we swap them. Then, we compare 2 with 4 and swap them. Now, the first three elements are sorted.

Online Sorting : Insertion sort is well-suited for \"online\" sorting, where new elements are continuously added to a sorted list.

This gradually builds up a sorted portion of the array. Let's look at an example: [4,3,2,10,12,1,5,6] We start by selecting the smallest element in the array, which is 1. We then swap it with the first element in the array. [1,3,2,10,12,4,5,6] We then select the next smallest element in the array, which is 2. We then swap it with the second element in the array. [1,2,3,10,12,4,5,6] We then select the next smallest element in the array, which is 3. 3 is already in the correct position, so we don't need to swap it. [1,2,3,10,12,4,5,6] We then select the next smallest element in the array, which is 4. We then swap it with the fourth element in the array. [1,2,3,4,12,10,5,6] We then select the next smallest element in the array, which is 5. We then swap it with the fifth element in the array. [1,2,3,4,5,10,12,6] We then select the next smallest element in the array, which is 6. We then swap it with the sixth element in the array. [1,2,3,4,5,6,12,10] We then select the next smallest element in the array, which is 10. We then swap it with the seventh element in the array. [1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12] 12 is already in the correct position, so we don't need to swap it. [1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12] The array is now sorted. The Process Initialization : The algorithm divides the array into two parts: a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. The sorted portion starts as an empty set, and the unsorted portion includes all the elements of the array. Selection of Minimum : In each iteration, the algorithm searches through the unsorted portion to find the minimum element. Swap and Grow Sorted Portion : Once the minimum element is found, it is swapped with the first element of the unsorted portion. This effectively grows the sorted portion of the array.

Function Signature /** * Sorts an array using the Selection Sort algorithm. * @param {number[]} array The array to be sorted. * @returns {number[]} The sorted array. */ function selectionSort(array: number[]): number[]; Examples console.log(selectionSort([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] console.log(selectionSort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])); // Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90] Constraints The input array can contain any number of elements. The elements in the input array are unique and positive integers. Notes The Selection Sort algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. This process continues until the whole array is sorted. Hints Outer Loop: The main idea of this algorithm is to divide the array into two parts: the \"sorted\" part and the \"unsorted\" part. The outer loop will iterate through the unsorted part and select the minimum element in each iteration. Inner Loop: The inner loop will find the minimum element in the unsorted part and swap it with the first element in the unsorted part. This effectively moves the minimum element to the sorted part. Current Minimum: Keep track of the index of the current minimum element found in the inner loop. You will need this index to perform the swap.
